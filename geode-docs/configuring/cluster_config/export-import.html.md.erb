The cluster configuration service exports and imports configurations created using `gfsh` for an entire Apache Geode cluster.

The cluster configuration service saves the cluster configuration as you create a regions, disk-stores and other objects using `gfsh` commands. You can export this configuration as well as any jar files that contain application files to a zip file and then import this configuration to create a new cluster.

## Exporting a Cluster Configuration

Issue the `gfsh` `export cluster-configuration` command to save the configuration data for your cluster in a zip file. This zip file contains subdirectories for cluster-level configurations and a directory for each group specified in the cluster. The contents of these directories are described in [Cluster Configuration Files and Troubleshooting](gfsh_config_troubleshooting.html#concept_ylt_2cb_y4).

To export a cluster configuration, run the `gfsh` `export cluster-configuration` command while connected to a Geode cluster. For example:

``` pre
export cluster-configuration --zip-file-name=myClusterConfig.zip --dir=/home/username/configs
```

See [export cluster-configuration](../../tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/export.html#topic_mdv_jgz_ck).

**Note:**
`gfsh` only saves cluster configuration values for configurations specified using `gfsh`. Configurations created by the management API are not saved with the cluster configurations.

## Importing a Cluster Configuration

You can import a cluster configuration to a running locator. After importing the configuration, any servers you start receive this cluster configuration.

To import a cluster configuration, start one or more locators and then run the `gfsh` `import cluster-configuration` command. For example:

``` pre
import cluster-configuration --zip-file-name=/home/username/configs/myClusterConfig.zip
```

See [import cluster-configuration](../../tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/import.html#topic_vnv_grz_ck).

**Note:**
You cannot import a cluster configuration to a cluster where cache servers are already running.
