When you use the cluster configuration service in Geode, you can examine the generated configuration files in the `cluster_config` directory on the locator. `gfsh` saves configuration files at the cluster-level and at the individual group-level.

The following directories and configuration files are available on the locator running the cluster configuration service:

**Cluster-level configuration**  
For configurations that apply to all members of a cluster, the locator creates a `cluster` subdirectory within the `cluster_config` directory (or in the cluster configuration directory when starting up the locator with the `--cluster-config-dir=value` parameter) specified. All servers receive this configuration when they are started using `gfsh`. This directory contains:

-   `cluster.xml` -- A Geode `cache.xml` file containing configuration common to all members
-   `cluster.properties` -- a Geode ` gemfire.properties` file containing properties common to all members
-   Jar files that are intended for deployment to all members

<!-- -->

**Group-level configuration**  
When you specify the `--group` parameter in a `gfsh` command, (for example, `start server` or `create region`) the locator writes the configurations for each group in a subdirectory with the same name as the group. When you start a server that specifies one or more group names, the server receives both the cluster-level configurations and the configurations from all groups specified. This subdirectory contains:

-   `<group-name>.xml` -- A Geode `cache.xml` file containing configurations common to all members of the group
-   `<group-name>.properties` -- A Geode `gemfire.properties` file containing properties common to all members of the group
-   Jar files that are intended for deployment to all members of the group

You can export a zip file that contains all artifacts of a cluster configuration. The zip file contains all of the files in the `cluster_config` (or otherwise specified) subdirectory of a locator. You can import this configuration to a new cluster. See [Exporting and Importing Cluster Configurations](export-import.html#concept_wft_dkq_34).

## Individual Configuration Files and Cluster Configuration Files

Geode applies the cluster-wide configuration files first and then group-level configurations next. If a member has its own configuration files defined (cache.xml and gemfire.properties files), those configurations are applied last. Whenever possible, use the member group-level configuration files in the cluster-configuration service to apply non-cluster-wide configurations on individual members.

## Troubleshooting Tips

-   When you start a locator using `gfsh`, you should see the following message:

    ``` pre
    Cluster configuration service is up and running.
    ```

    If you do not see this message, there may be a problem with the cluster configuration service. Use the `status cluster-configuration-service` command to check the status of the cluster configuration.

    -   If the command returns RUNNING, the cluster configuration is running normally.
    -   If the command returns WAITING, run the `status locator` command. The output of this command returns the cause of the WAITING status.
-   If a server start fails with the following exception: `ClusterConfigurationNotAvailableException`, the cluster configuration service may not be in the RUNNING state. Because the server requests the cluster configuration from the locator, which is not available, the `start server` command fails.
-   You can determine what configurations a server received from a locator by examining the server's log file. See [Logging](../../managing/logging/logging.html#concept_30DB86B12B454E168B80BB5A71268865).
-   If a `start server` command specifies a cache.xml file that conflicts with the existing cluster configuration, the server startup may fail.
-   If a `gfsh` command fails because the cluster configuration cannot be saved, the following message displays:

    ``` pre
    Failed to persist the configuration changes due to this command, 
    Revert the command to maintain consistency. Please use "status cluster-config-service" 
    to determine whether Cluster configuration service is RUNNING."
    ```

-   There are some types of configurations that cannot be made using `gfsh`. See [gfsh Limitations](gfsh_persist.html#concept_r22_hyw_bl__section_bn3_23p_y4).
