Use the `gfsh` command-line utility to configure your <%=vars.product_name_long%> cluster. The cluster configuration service persists the cluster configurations and distributes the configurations to members of the cluster. There are also several additional ways to configure a cluster.

Use `gfsh` to configure regions, disk stores, members, and other <%=vars.product_name%> objects. 
You can also use `gfsh` to start and stop locators, servers, and <%=vars.product_name%> monitoring tools. As you execute these commands, the cluster configuration service persists the configuration. When new members join the cluster, the service distributes the configuration to the new members.

`gfsh` is the recommended means of configuring and managing your <%=vars.product_name_long%> cluster, however you can still configure many aspects of a cluster using the older methods of the cache.xml and gemfire.properties files. See [cache.xml](../reference/topics/chapter_overview_cache_xml.html#cache_xml) and the [Reference](../reference/book_intro.html#reference) for configuration parameters. You can also configure some aspects of a cluster using a Java API. See [Managing <%=vars.product_name_long%>](../managing/book_intro.html#managing_gemfire_intro).

-   **[Overview of the Cluster Configuration Service](cluster_config/gfsh_persist.html)**

    The <%=vars.product_name_long%> cluster configuration service persists cluster configurations created by `gfsh` commands to the locators in a cluster and distributes the configurations to members of the cluster.

-   **[Tutorialâ€”Creating and Using a Cluster Configuration](cluster_config/persisting_configurations.html)**

    A short walk-through that uses a single computer to demonstrate how to use `gfsh` to create a cluster configuration for a <%=vars.product_name%> cluster.

-   **[Deploying Application JARs to <%=vars.product_name_long%> Members](cluster_config/deploying_application_jars.html)**

    You can dynamically deploy your application JAR files to specific members or to all members in your cluster. <%=vars.product_name%> automatically keeps track of JAR file versions; autoloads the deployed JAR files to the CLASSPATH; and auto-registers any functions that the JAR contains.

-   **[Using Member Groups](cluster_config/using_member_groups.html)**

    <%=vars.product_name_long%> allows you to organize your cluster members into logical member groups.

-   **[Exporting and Importing Cluster Configurations](cluster_config/export-import.html)**

    The cluster configuration service exports and imports configurations created using `gfsh` for an entire <%=vars.product_name_long%> cluster.

-   **[Cluster Configuration Files and Troubleshooting](cluster_config/gfsh_config_troubleshooting.html)**

    When you use the cluster configuration service in <%=vars.product_name%>, you can examine the generated configuration files in the `cluster_config` directory on the locator. `gfsh` saves configuration files at the cluster-level and at the individual group-level.

-   **[Using gfsh to Manage a Remote Cluster Over HTTP or HTTPS](cluster_config/gfsh_remote.html)**

    You can connect `gfsh` via HTTP or HTTPS to a remote cluster and manage the cluster using `gfsh` commands.

-   **[Deploying Configuration Files without the Cluster Configuration Service](running/deploying_config_files.html)**

    You can deploy your <%=vars.product_name_long%> configuration files in your system directory structure or in jar files. You determine how you want to deploy your configuration files and set them up accordingly.

-   **[Starting Up and Shutting Down Your System](running/starting_up_shutting_down.html)**

    Determine the proper startup and shutdown procedures, and write your startup and shutdown scripts.

-   **[Running <%=vars.product_name%> Locator Processes](running/running_the_locator.html)**

    The locator is a <%=vars.product_name%> process that tells new, connecting members where running members are located and provides load balancing for server use.

-   **[Running <%=vars.product_name%> Server Processes](running/running_the_cacheserver.html)**

    A <%=vars.product_name%> server is a process that runs as a long-lived, configurable member of a client/server system.

-   **[Managing System Output Files](running/managing_output_files.html)**

    <%=vars.product_name%> output files are optional and can become quite large. Work with your system administrator to determine where to place them to avoid interfering with other system activities.

-   **[Firewall Considerations](running/firewall_ports_config.html)**

    You can configure and limit port usage for situations that involve firewalls, for example, between client-server or server-server connections.
