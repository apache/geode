**Note:** This feature is experimental and is subject to change in future releases of <%=vars.product_name_long%>.

The cluster management service enables you to change the configuration of
the cluster using a REST interface,
and have these changes replicated to all the applicable servers
and persisted within the cluster configuration service.

This REST interface differs from gfsh commands in:

- The REST interface allows for a more programmable access.

- Changes to all members of the cluster are applied in a consistent manner.

- REST interface changes may be invoked from a server via a function
or from any client application.

- You can configure the cluster without having any servers running.
Having a locator running is sufficient.

- Not all gfsh commands and options are available with this REST interface.

Currently, <%=vars.product_name%> provides a Java client to interact with
the REST interface.
There is also a Golang client that interacts with the REST interface.

The cluster management service REST API adheres to standard REST semantics,
so users can use POST, PATCH, DELETE, and GET to create,
update, delete, and read, respectively.

See the versioned documentation at [Cluster Management Service REST API](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Cluster+Management+Service+Rest+API) for more details.
This version of <%=vars.product_name%> uses the <%=vars.product_version_geode%> Management REST API.

## Cluster Management Configuration

Locators started by gfsh support the cluster management service REST API.

Three property settings must be in effect to enable the cluster management REST API. These are in effect, by default, for gfsh-initiated locators.

- `http-service-port` must be set to a non-zero value. If set to zero,
no HTTP service is available for the locator. The default HTTP service port is 7070.

- `enable-cluster-configuration` must be set to true.
When set to false, all of the cluster management service REST API calls return errors.

- `enable-management-rest-service` must be set to true.
When set to false, the cluster management REST service does not start.

By default, cluster management REST service logging occurs at the debug level.
To increase logging to the info level,
set the system property `-Dgeode.management.request.logging=true`
when you start up locators.

## Authentication and Authorization

Secure your cluster management service REST API
by implementing the `SecurityManager` interface.
When the interface is implemented,
API requests require credentials.

Credentials can take the form of a username/password pair or a valid bearer token.
By default, the cluster management service expects credentials in the form of 
a username and password, as in the example:

```
curl --user username:password http://example.com/management/regions
```

When the `security-auth-token-enabled-components` property is set to 
`all` or `management`,
the cluster management service expects credentials in the form of a valid bearer token.
For example:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer Y6bXlwYXNzdzByZAo" http://example.com/management/regions
```

## Java API

The Java client allows you to use the REST interface API in
your Java application.
To use the API:

- Include `geode-management.jar` in your application's classpath.

- Use the `ClusterManagementServiceBuilder` class to build a
`ClusterManagementService` object,
using the various methods available on the builder to set
the connection configuration.

Example:

```
ClusterManagementService cmsClient = new ClusterManagementServiceBuilder()
        .setHost("localhost")
        .setPort("7070")
        .build();
Region regionConfig = new Region();
ClusterManagementListResult<Region, RuntimeRegionInfo> list = cmsClient.list(region);
```

## Golang Command Line Interface

A Golang client that interacts with this service is available at
[https://github.com/gemfire/tanzu-gemfire-management-cf-plugin](https://github.com/gemfire/tanzu-gemfire-management-cf-plugin).

After download, you can use it to interact with any running cluster.
For example:

```
$ ./gemfire http://localhost:7070 list regions
```
