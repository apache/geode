You can configure and limit port usage for situations that involve firewalls, for example, between client-server or server-server connections.

-   **[Firewalls and Connections](../../configuring/running/firewalls_connections.html)**

    Be aware of possible connection problems that can result from running a firewall on your machine.

-   **[Firewalls and Ports](../../configuring/running/firewalls_ports.html)**

    Make sure your port settings are configured correctly for firewalls.
