Use expiration to keep data current and to reduce region size by removing stale entries. Expiration actions are triggered by time-based thresholds.

-   **[How Expiration Works](how_expiration_works.html)**

    Expiration removes old entries and entries that you are not using. You can choose whether expired entries are invalidated or destroyed.

-   **[Configure Data Expiration](configuring_data_expiration.html)**

    Configure the type of expiration and the expiration action to use.
