The Apache Geode data storage and distribution models put your data in the right place at the right time. You should understand all the options for data storage in Geode before you configure your data regions.

-   **[Storage and Distribution Options](../../developing/region_options/storage_distribution_options.html)**

    Geode provides several models for data storage and distribution, including partitioned or replicated regions as well as distributed or non-distributed regions (local cache storage).

-   **[Region Types](../../developing/region_options/region_types.html)**

    Region types define region behavior within a single distributed system. You have various options for region data storage and distribution.

-   **[Region Data Stores and Data Accessors](../../developing/region_options/data_hosts_and_accessors.html)**

    Understand the difference between members that store data for a region and members that act only as data accessors to the region.

-   **[Creating Regions Dynamically](../../developing/region_options/dynamic_region_creation.html)**

    You can dynamically create regions in your application code and automatically instantiate them on members of a distributed system.
