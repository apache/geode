The <%=vars.product_name_long%> data storage and distribution models put your data in the right place at the right time. You should understand all the options for data storage in <%=vars.product_name%> before you configure your data regions.

-   **[Storage and Distribution Options](storage_distribution_options.html)**

    <%=vars.product_name%> provides several models for data storage and distribution, including partitioned or replicated regions as well as distributed or non-distributed regions (local cache storage).

-   **[Region Types](region_types.html)**

    Region types define region behavior within a single cluster. You have various options for region data storage and distribution.

-   **[Region Data Stores and Data Accessors](data_hosts_and_accessors.html)**

    Understand the difference between members that store data for a region and members that act only as data accessors to the region.

-   **[Creating Regions Dynamically](dynamic_region_creation.html)**

    You can dynamically create regions in your application code and automatically instantiate them on members of a cluster.
