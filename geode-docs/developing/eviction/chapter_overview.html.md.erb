Use eviction to control data region size. Eviction actions are triggered by space-based thresholds.

-   **[How Eviction Works](how_eviction_works.html)**

    Eviction settings cause <%=vars.product_name_long%> to work to keep a region's resource use under a specified level by removing least recently used (LRU) entries to make way for new entries.

-   **[Configure Data Eviction](configuring_data_eviction.html)**

    Configure a region's `eviction-attributes` settings to keep your region within a specified limit.
