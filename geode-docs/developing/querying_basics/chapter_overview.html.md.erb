<%=vars.product_name%> provides a SQL-like querying language called OQL that allows you to access data stored in <%=vars.product_name%> regions.

Since <%=vars.product_name%> regions are key-value stores where values can range from simple byte arrays to complex
nested objects, <%=vars.product_name%> uses a query syntax based on OQL (Object Query Language) to query region
data. OQL is very similar to SQL, but OQL allows you to query complex objects, object attributes,
and methods.
