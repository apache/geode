Geode provides a SQL-like querying language called OQL that allows you to access data stored in Geode regions.

Since Geode regions are key-value stores where values can range from simple byte arrays to complex nested objects, Geode uses a query syntax based on OQL (Object Query Language) to query region data. OQL is very similar to SQL, but OQL allows you to query complex objects, object attributes, and methods.
