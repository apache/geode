At a high level, Geode does not support the following querying features:

-   Indexes targeted for joins across more than one region are not supported
-   Static method invocations. For example, the following query is invalid:

    ``` pre
    SELECT DISTINCT * FROM /QueryRegion0 WHERE aDay = Day.Wednesday
    ```

-   You cannot create an index on fields using Set/List types (Collection types) that are not comparable. The OQL index implementation expects fields to be Comparable. To workaround this, you can create a custom Collection type that implements Comparable.
-   ORDER BY is only supported with DISTINCT queries.

In addition, there are some specific limitations on partitioned region querying. See [Partitioned Region Query Restrictions](../query_additional/partitioned_region_query_restrictions.html#concept_5353476380D44CC1A7F586E5AE1CE7E8).
