| AND                    | Logical operator used to create complex expressions by combining two or more expressions to produce a Boolean result.

| IS\_UNDEFINED          | Query function. Returns TRUE if the expression evaluates to UNDEFINED. In most queries, undefined values are not included in the query results. The IS\_UNDEFINED function allows undefined values to be included, so you can identify element with undefined values.                                                                               | See [Preset Query Functions](../query_select/the_select_statement.html#concept_85AE7D6B1E2941ED8BD2A8310A81753E__section_69DCAD624E9640028BC86FD67649DEB2)                                                                         |

| LIKE                   | LIKE can be used to mean 'equals to', or if you terminate the string with a wildcard character (`%`), it behaves like 'starts with'. Note that the wildcard can only be used at the end of the comparison string. You can escape the wildcard character to represent the `%` character. You can also use the LIKE predicate if an index is present. | See [LIKE](../query_select/the_where_clause.html#the_where_clause__section_D91E0B06FFF6431490CC0BFA369425AD)                                                                                                                       |
