Configure in-memory high availability for your partitioned region by specifying the number of secondary copies you want to maintain in the region's data stores.

Specify the number of redundant copies you want for your partitioned region data in the partition attribute `redundant-copies` setting. The default setting is 0. 

For example:

-   XML:

    ``` pre
    <region name="PR1"> 
      <region-attributes refid="PARTITION"> 
        <partition-attributes redundant-copies="1"/> 
      </region-attributes> 
    </region> 
    ```

-   Java:

    ``` pre
    PartitionAttributes pa = 
        new PartitionAttributesFactory().setRedundantCopies(1).create(); 
    ```

-   gfsh:

    ``` pre
    gfsh>create region --name="PR1" --type=PARTITION --redundant-copies=1
    ```
