Configure Geode to use only unique physical machines for redundant copies of partitioned region data.

Understand how to set a member's `gemfire.properties` settings. See [Reference](../../reference/book_intro.html#reference).

Configure your members so Geode always uses different physical machines for redundant copies of partitioned region data using the `gemfire.properties` setting `enforce-unique-host`. The default for this setting is false. 

Example:

``` pre
enforce-unique-host=true
```
