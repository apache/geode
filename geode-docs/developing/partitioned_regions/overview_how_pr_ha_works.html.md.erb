By default, Apache Geode stores only a single copy of your partitioned region data among the region's data stores. You can configure Geode to maintain redundant copies of your partitioned region data for high availability.

-   **[Understanding High Availability for Partitioned Regions](../../developing/partitioned_regions/how_pr_ha_works.html)**

    With high availability, each member that hosts data for the partitioned region gets some primary copies and some redundant (secondary) copies.

-   **[Configure High Availability for a Partitioned Region](../../developing/partitioned_regions/configuring_ha_for_pr.html)**

    Configure in-memory high availability for your partitioned region. Set other high-availability options, like redundancy zones and redundancy recovery strategies.
