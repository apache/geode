Geode provides a transactions API, with `begin`, `commit`, and `rollback` methods. These methods are much the same as the familiar relational database transactions methods.

-   **[About Transactions](../../developing/transactions/about_transactions.html)**

    This section covers the features of Geode transactions.
It also details the two kinds of transaction that Geode supports:
**Geode cache transactions** and **JTA global transactions**.

-   **[Geode Cache Transactions](../../developing/transactions/cache_transactions.html)**

    Use Geode cache transactions to group the execution of cache operations and to gain the control offered by transactional commit and rollback. Geode cache transactions control operations within the Geode cache while the Geode distributed system handles data distribution in the usual way.

-   **[JTA Global Transactions with Geode](../../developing/transactions/JTA_transactions.html)**

    Use JTA global transactions to coordinate Geode cache transactions and JDBC transactions.

-   **[Monitoring and Troubleshooting Transactions](../../developing/transactions/monitor_troubleshoot_transactions.html)**

    This topic covers errors that may occur when running transactions in Geode.

-   **[Transaction Coding Examples](../../developing/transactions/transaction_coding_examples.html)**

    This section provides several code examples for writing and executing transactions.
