This section describes <%=vars.product_name%> transactions.
<%=vars.product_name%> offers an API for client applications that do
transactional work.
While the implementation of the API does not provide
applications a rigid adherence to all the ACID properties of transactions,
it handles many situations.
There are the familiar `begin`, `commit`, and `rollback` methods
that implement the same operations as in 
relational database transactions methods.

-   **[Adherence to ACID Promises](transactions_intro.html)**
  
    This section explains the ways in which <%=vars.product_name%> does
and does not adhere to ACID semantics.

-   **[Code Examples](directed_example.html)**

    An application-based transaction and a transaction embedded in
    a function provide examples to model.

-   **[Design Considerations](design_considerations.html)**

    Designs that extend beyond the basics introduce other considerations.
    This section identifies and discusses how transactions interact
    with other aspects of the system.
