<%=vars.product_name%> provides a transactions API, with `begin`, `commit`, and `rollback` methods. These methods are much the same as the familiar relational database transactions methods.

-   **[Introduction and the Application of ACID Semantics](about_transactions.html)**

    This section presents the features of <%=vars.product_name%> transactions and discusses how the implementation adheres to ACID semantics.
It also details the two kinds of transaction that <%=vars.product_name%> supports:
**<%=vars.product_name%> transactions** and **JTA global transactions**.

-   **[<%=vars.product_name%> Transactions](cache_transactions.html)**

    Use <%=vars.product_name%> transactions to group the execution of cache operations and to gain the control offered by transactional commit and rollback. <%=vars.product_name%> transactions control operations within the <%=vars.product_name%> cache while the <%=vars.product_name%> distributed system handles data distribution in the usual way.

-   **[JTA Global Transactions with <%=vars.product_name%>](JTA_transactions.html)**

    Use JTA global transactions to coordinate <%=vars.product_name%> transactions and JDBC transactions.

-   **[Monitoring and Troubleshooting Transactions](monitor_troubleshoot_transactions.html)**

    This topic covers errors that may occur when running transactions in <%=vars.product_name%>.

-   **[Transaction Coding Examples](transaction_coding_examples.html)**

    This section provides several code examples for writing and executing transactions.
