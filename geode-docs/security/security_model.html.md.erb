Every component of Apache Geode is built with security considerations as a top priority. However, certain security
solutions require user-specific design and implementation. Geode's default configuration combines maximum flexibility
and performance without any input needed from the user. Because of this, certain security measures like 
**[authentication](authentication_overview.html)**, 
**[authorization](authorization_overview.html)**,
**[serialization](../security/serialization.html)** and 
**[over-the-wire encryption](ssl_overview.html)** 
are absent from a default Geode installation.
It is highly recommended that users review Geode's security capabilities and implement them as they see fit. See the 
**[Security Implementation Introduction and Overview](implementing_security.html)**
to get started with Apache Geode security.

Additional documentation related to security can be found on Apache Geode Wiki 

[Geode Security Framework](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Geode+Security+Framework) and 
[Geode Integrated Security](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Geode+Integrated+Security).
