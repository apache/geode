Apache Geode offers mechanisms to control and filter object serialization, particularly 
 in the context of security and performance. This is primarily achieved through:


##  Global Serialization Filter (Java 8)

For deployments using Java 8, a global serialization filter can be enabled to restrict the types of objects that can be serialized and 
deserialized within the Geode process. This helps mitigate risks associated with deserialization of untrusted data, a common vulnerability.

- To enable this, the Java system property `geode.enableGlobalSerialFilter` is set to true when starting Geode locators and servers.

- Additionally, the `serializable-object-filter` configuration option, used in conjunction with `validate-serializable-objects,` is used to 
specify a whitelist of user-defined classes that are allowed to be serialized/deserialized, in addition to standard JDK and Geode classes. 
 This allows for fine-grained control over which custom objects are permitted in the system.

##  PDX Serialization

Apache Geode's Portable Data eXchange (PDX) serialization offers a more robust and flexible approach to data serialization, providing features
like schema evolution and language independence. While not a "filter" in the same sense as the global serialization filter, PDX provides control
over how objects are serialized and deserialized.

- **PdxSerializer:** You can implement a custom `PdxSerializer` to define how specific domain objects are serialized and deserialized, allowing
 for selective handling of fields or transformations during the process.

- **Reflection-Based Auto-Serialization:** PDX also supports automatic reflection-based serialization, where Geode can serialize objects without
 requiring explicit implementation of `PdxSerializable` in your domain classes. This can be configured to include or exclude specific types based
  on criteria like package names, providing a form of type filtering.



  
 In conclusion, Apache Geode provides serialization filtering capabilities through a global filter for security hardening in Java 8 environments and
   through the flexible configurations of PDX serialization for fine-grained control over data handling and type inclusion/exclusion.
