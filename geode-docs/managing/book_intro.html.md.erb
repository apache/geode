*Managing Apache Geode* describes how to plan and implement tasks associated with managing, monitoring, and troubleshooting Apache Geode.

-   **[Apache Geode Management and Monitoring](../managing/management/management_and_monitoring.html)**

    Apache Geode provides APIs and tools for managing your distributed system and monitoring the health of your distributed system members.

-   **[Managing Heap and Off-heap Memory](../managing/heap_use/heap_management.html)**

    By default, Apache Geode uses the JVM heap. Apache Geode also offers an option to store data off heap. This section describes how to manage heap and off-heap memory to best support your application.

-   **[Disk Storage](../managing/disk_storage/chapter_overview.html)**

    With Apache Geode disk stores, you can persist data to disk as a backup to your in-memory copy and overflow data to disk when memory use gets too high.

-   **[Cache and Region Snapshots](../managing/cache_snapshots/chapter_overview.html)**

    Snapshots allow you to save region data and reload it later. A typical use case is loading data from one environment into another, such as capturing data from a production system and moving it into a smaller QA or development system.

-   **[Region Compression](../managing/region_compression/region_compression.html)**

    This section describes region compression, its benefits and usage.

-   **[Network Partitioning](../managing/network_partitioning/chapter_overview.html)**

    Apache Geode architecture and management features help detect and resolve network partition problems.

-   **[Security](../managing/security/chapter_overview.html)**

    The security framework establishes trust by authenticating components 
    and members upon connection. It facilitates the authorization of operations.

-   **[Performance Tuning and Configuration](../managing/monitor_tune/chapter_overview.html)**

    A collection of tools and controls allow you to monitor and adjust Apache Geode performance.

-   **[Logging](../managing/logging/logging.html)**

    Comprehensive logging messages help you confirm system configuration and debug problems in configuration and code.

-   **[Statistics](../managing/statistics/chapter_overview.html)**

    Every application and server in a distributed system can access statistical data about Apache Geode operations. You can configure the gathering of statistics by using the `alter runtime` command of `gfsh` or in the `gemfire.properties` file to facilitate system analysis and troubleshooting.

-   **[Troubleshooting and System Recovery](../managing/troubleshooting/chapter_overview.html)**

    This section provides strategies for handling common errors and failure situations.
