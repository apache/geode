When many peer processes are started concurrently, you can improve the distributed system connect time can by setting the p2p.HANDSHAKE\_POOL\_SIZE system property value to the expected number of members.

This property controls the number of threads that can be used to establish new TCP/IP connections between peer caches. The threads are discarded if they are idle for 60 seconds.

The default value for p2p.HANDSHAKE\_POOL\_SIZE is 10. This command-line specification sets the number of threads to 100:

``` pre
-Dp2p.HANDSHAKE_POOL_SIZE=100
```
