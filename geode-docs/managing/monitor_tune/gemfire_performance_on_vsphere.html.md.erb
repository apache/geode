title:  Improving Geode Performance on vSphere
---

This topic provides guidelines for tuning vSphere virtualized environments that host Apache Geode deployments.

Without tuning, Geode can suffer a performance drop in virtual environments, including the VMware vSphere virtual platform.

You can expect to see significant performance degradation when running Geode on vSphere versus running Geode on dedicated hardware.
