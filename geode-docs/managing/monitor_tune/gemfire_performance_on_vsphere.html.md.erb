This topic provides guidelines for tuning vSphere virtualized environments that host Apache Geode deployments.

Without tuning, Geode can suffer a performance drop in virtual environments, including the VMware vSphere virtual platform.

You can expect to see significant performance degradation when running Geode on vSphere versus running Geode on dedicated hardware.

-   **[Operating System Guidelines](gemfire_performance_on_vsphere_guidelines.html#topic_F48990A6A37144988D49E132E17E117C)**

    Use the latest supported version of the guest OS, and use Java large paging.
