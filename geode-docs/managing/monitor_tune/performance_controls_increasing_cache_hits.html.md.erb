The more frequently a get fails to find a valid value in the first cache and has to try a second cache, the more the overall performance is affected.

A common cause of misses is expiration or eviction of the entry. If you have a regionâ€™s entry expiration or eviction enabled, monitor the region and entry statistics.

If you see a high ratio of misses to hits on the entries, consider increasing the expiration times or the maximum values for eviction, if possible. See [Eviction](../../developing/eviction/chapter_overview.html) for more information.
