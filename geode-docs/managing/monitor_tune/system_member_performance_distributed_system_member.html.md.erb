Several performance-related properties apply to a cache server or application that connects to the distributed system.

-   **statistic-sampling-enabled**.Turning off statistics sampling saves resources, but it also takes away potentially valuable information for ongoing system tuning and unexpected system problems. If LRU eviction is configured, then statistics sampling must be on.
-   **statistic-sample-rate**. Increasing the sample rate for statistics reduces system resource use while still providing some statistics for system tuning and failure analysis.
-   **log-level**. As with the statistic sample rate, lowering this setting reduces system resource consumption. See [Logging](../logging/logging.html#concept_30DB86B12B454E168B80BB5A71268865).
