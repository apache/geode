title:  Ephemeral TCP Port Limits
---

By default, Windows’ ephemeral ports are within the range 1024-4999, inclusive.You can increase the range.

If you are repeatedly receiving the following exception:

``` pre
java.net.BindException: Address already in use: connect
```

and if your system is experiencing a high degree of network activity, such as numerous short-lived client connections, this could be related to a limit on the number of ephemeral TCP ports. While this issue could occur with other operating systems, typically, it is only seen with Windows due to a low default limit.

Perform this procedure to increase the limit:

1.  Open the Windows Registry Editor.
2.  Navigate to the following key:

    ``` pre
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameter
    ```

3.  From the Edit menu, click New, and then add the following registry entry:

    ``` pre
    Value Name: MaxUserPort 
    Value Type: DWORD  
    Value data: 36863
    ```

4.  Exit the Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.

This affects all versions of the Windows operating system.

**Note for UDP on Unix Systems**

Unix systems have a default maximum socket buffer size for receiving UDP multicast and unicast transmissions that is lower than the default settings for mcast-recv-buffer-size and udp-recv-buffer-size. To achieve high-volume multicast messaging, you should increase the maximum Unix buffer size to at least one megabyte.
