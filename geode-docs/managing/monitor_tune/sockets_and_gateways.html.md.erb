When you determine buffer size settings, you try to strike a balance between communication needs and other processing.

This table lists the settings for gateway relationships and protocols, and tells where to set them.

**TCP/IP Buffer Sizes**

If possible, your TCP/IP buffer size settings should match across your installation. At a minimum, follow the guidelines listed here.

-   **Multisite (WAN)**. In a multi-site installation using gateways, if the link between sites is not tuned for optimum throughput, it could cause messages to back up in the cache queues. If a receiving queue overflows because of inadequate buffer sizes, it will become out of sync with the sender and the receiver will be unaware of the condition.

    The gateway sender's socket-buffer-size attribute should match the gateway receiverâ€™s socket-buffer-size attribute for all gateway receivers that the sender connects to, as in these example `cache.xml` snippets:

    ``` pre
    Gateway Sender Socket Buffer Size cache.xml Configuration: 

    <gateway-sender id="sender2" parallel="true"
     remote-distributed-system-id="2"
     socket-buffer-size="42000"
     maximum-queue-memory="150"/>

    Gateway Receiver Socket Buffer Size cache.xml Configuration:
    <gateway-receiver start-port="1530" end-port="1551"
     socket-buffer-size="42000"/>  
    ```

**Note:**
WAN deployments increase the messaging demands on a <%=vars.product_name%> system. To avoid hangs related to WAN messaging, always use the default setting of <code class="ph codeph">conserve-sockets=false</code> for <%=vars.product_name%> members that participate in a WAN deployment.

Each gateway sender and gateway receiver uses a socket to distribute events or to listen for incoming connections from remote sites.

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Listener for incoming connections</p></td>

Servers are peers in their own clusters and have the additional socket requirements as noted in the Peer-to-Peer section above.

## <a id="socket_comm__section_66D11C8E84F941B58800EDB52194B087" class="no-quick-link"></a>Member produces SocketTimeoutException

A client, server, gateway sender, or gateway receiver produces a `SocketTimeoutException` when it stops waiting for a response from the other side of the connection and closes the socket. This exception typically happens on the handshake or when establishing a callback connection.

Response:

Increase the default socket timeout setting for the member. This timeout is set separately for the client Pool and for the gateway sender and gateway receiver, either in the `cache.xml` file or through the API. For a client/server configuration, adjust the "read-timeout" value as described in [&lt;pool&gt;](../../reference/topics/client-cache.html#cc-pool) or use the `org.apache.geode.cache.client.PoolFactory.setReadTimeout` method. For a gateway sender or gateway receiver, see [WAN Configuration](../../reference/topics/elements_ref.html#topic_7B1CABCAD056499AA57AF3CFDBF8ABE3).
