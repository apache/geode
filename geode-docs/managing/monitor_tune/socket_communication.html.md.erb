Geode processes communicate using TCP/IP and UDP unicast and multicast protocols. In all cases, communication uses sockets that you can tune to optimize performance.

The adjustments you make to tune your Geode communication may run up against operating system limits. If this happens, check with your system administrator about adjusting the operating system settings.

All of the settings discussed here are listed as `gemfire.properties` and `cache.xml` settings. They can also be configured through the API and some can be configured at the command line. Before you begin, you should understand Geode [Basic Configuration and Programming](../../basic_config/book_intro.html).

-   **[Setting Socket Buffer Sizes](../../managing/monitor_tune/socket_communication_setting_socket_buffer_sizes.html)**

    When you determine buffer size settings, you try to strike a balance between communication needs and other processing.

-   **[Ephemeral TCP Port Limits](../../managing/monitor_tune/socket_communication_ephemeral_tcp_port_limits.html)**

    By default, Windowsâ€™ ephemeral ports are within the range 1024-4999, inclusive.You can increase the range.

-   **[Making Sure You Have Enough Sockets](../../managing/monitor_tune/socket_communication_have_enough_sockets.html)**

    The number of sockets available to your applications is governed by operating system limits.

-   **[TCP/IP KeepAlive Configuration](../../managing/monitor_tune/socket_tcp_keepalive.html)**

    Geode supports TCP KeepAlive to prevent socket connections from being timed out.

-   **[TCP/IP Peer-to-Peer Handshake Timeouts](../../managing/monitor_tune/socket_communication_tcpip_p2p_handshake_timeouts.html)**

    You can alleviate connection handshake timeouts for TCP/IP connections by increasing the connection handshake timeout interval with the system property p2p.handshakeTimeoutMs.
