This topic provides tuning suggestions of particular interest to developers, primarily programming techniques and cache configuration.

Before you begin, you should understand Apache Geode [Basic Configuration and Programming](../../basic_config/book_intro.html).

-   **[Data Serialization](../../managing/monitor_tune/performance_controls_data_serialization.html)**

    In addition to standard Java serialization, Geode offers serialization options that give you higher performance and greater flexibility for data storage, transfers, and language types.

-   **[Setting Cache Timeouts](../../managing/monitor_tune/performance_controls_setting_cache_timeouts.html)**

    Cache timeout properties can modified through the gfsh `alter runtime` command (or declared in the `cache.xml` file) and can also be set through methods of the interface, `org.apache.geode.cache.Cache`.

-   **[Controlling Socket Use](../../managing/monitor_tune/performance_controls_controlling_socket_use.html)**

    For peer-to-peer communication, you can manage socket use at the system member level and at the thread level.

-   **[Management of Slow Receivers](../../managing/monitor_tune/performance_controls_managing_slow_receivers.html)**

    You have several options for handling slow members that receive data distribution. The slow receiver options control only to peer-to-peer communication between distributed regions using TCP/IP. This topic does not apply to client/server or multi-site communication, or to communication using the UDP unicast or IP multicast protocols.

-   **[Increasing the Ratio of Cache Hits](../../managing/monitor_tune/performance_controls_increasing_cache_hits.html)**

    The more frequently a get fails to find a valid value in the first cache and has to try a second cache, the more the overall performance is affected.
