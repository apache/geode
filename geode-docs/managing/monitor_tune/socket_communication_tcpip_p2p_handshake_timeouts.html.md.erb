You can alleviate connection handshake timeouts for TCP/IP connections by increasing the connection handshake timeout interval with the system property `p2p.handshakeTimeoutMs`.

The default setting is 59000 milliseconds.

This sets the handshake timeout to 75000 milliseconds for a Java application:

``` pre
-Dp2p.handshakeTimeoutMs=75000
```

The properties are passed to the cache server on the `gfsh` command line:

``` pre
gfsh>start server --name=server_name --J=-Dp2p.handshakeTimeoutMs=75000
```
