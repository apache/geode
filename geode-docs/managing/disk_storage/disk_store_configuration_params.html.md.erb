You define your disk stores by using the `gfsh create disk-store` command or in `<disk-store>` subelements of your cache declaration in `cache.xml`. All disk stores are available for use by all of your regions and queues.

These `<disk-store>` attributes and subelements have corresponding `gfsh create disk-store` command-line parameters as well as getter and setter methods in the `org.apache.geode.cache.DiskStoreFactory` and `org.apache.geode.cache.DiskStore` APIs.

## <a id="disk_store_configuration_params__section_366001C72D674AF69B2CED91BFA73A9B" class="no-quick-link"></a>disk-dirs Element

The `<disk-dirs>` element defines the host system directories to use for the disk store. It contains one or more single `<disk-dir>` elements with the following contents:

-   The directory specification, provided as the text of the `disk-dir` element.
-   An optional `dir-size` attribute specifying the maximum amount of space, in megabytes, to use for the disk store in the directory. By default, there is no limit. The space used is calculated as the combined sizes of all oplog files.

You can specify any number of `disk-dir` subelements to the `disk-dirs` element. The data is spread evenly among the active disk files in the directories, keeping within any limits you set.

Example:

``` pre
<disk-dirs>
    <disk-dir>/host1/users/gf/memberA_DStore</disk-dir>
    <disk-dir>/host2/users/gf/memberA_DStore</disk-dir> 
    <disk-dir dir-size="20480">/host3/users/gf/memberA_DStore</disk-dir> 
</disk-dirs>
```

**Note:**
The directories must exist when the disk store is created or the system throws an exception. Geode does not create directories.

Use different disk-dir specifications for different disk stores. You cannot use the same directory for the same named disk store in two different members.
