The `gfsh` command-line tool has a number of options for examining and managing your disk stores. The `gfsh` tool, the `cache.xml` file and the DiskStore APIs are your management tools for online and offline disk stores.

See [Disk Store Commands](../../tools_modules/gfsh/quick_ref_commands_by_area.html#topic_1ACC91B493EE446E89EC7DBFBBAE00EA) for a list of available commands.
