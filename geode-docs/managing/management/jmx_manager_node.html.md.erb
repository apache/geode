Any member can host an embedded JMX Manager, which provides a federated view of all MBeans for the distributed system. The member can be configured to be a manager at startup or anytime during its life by invoking the appropriate API calls on the ManagementService.

You need to have a JMX Manager started in your distributed system in order to use Geode management and monitoring tools such as [gfsh](../../tools_modules/gfsh/chapter_overview.html) and [Geode Pulse](../../tools_modules/pulse/pulse-overview.html).

**Note:**
Each node that acts as the JMX Manager has additional memory requirements depending on the number of resources that it is managing and monitoring. Being a JMX Manager can increase the memory footprint of any process, including locator processes. See [Memory Requirements for Cached Data](../../reference/topics/memory_requirements_for_cache_data.html#calculating_memory_requirements) for more information on calculating memory overhead on your Geode processes.
