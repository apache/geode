Apache Geode provides APIs and tools for managing your distributed system and monitoring the health of your distributed system members.

-   **[Management and Monitoring Features](../../managing/management/management_and_monitoring_features.html)**

    Apache Geode uses a federated Open MBean strategy to manage and monitor all members of the distributed system. This strategy gives you a consolidated, single-agent view of the distributed system.

-   **[Overview of Geode Management and Monitoring Tools](../../managing/management/mm_overview.html)**

    Geode provides a variety of management tools you can use to manage a Geode distributed system.

-   **[Architecture and Components](../../managing/management/management_system_overview.html)**

    Geode's management and monitoring system consists of one JMX Manager node (there should only be one) and one or more managed nodes within a distributed system. All members in the distributed system are manageable through MBeans and Geode Management Service APIs.

-   **[JMX Manager Operations](../../managing/management/jmx_manager_node.html#topic_36C918B4202D45F3AC225FFD23B11D7C)**

    Any member can host an embedded JMX Manager, which provides a federated view of all MBeans for the distributed system. The member can be configured to be a manager at startup or anytime during its life by invoking the appropriate API calls on the ManagementService.

-   **[Federated MBean Architecture](../../managing/management/mbean_architecture.html)**

    Geode uses MBeans to manage and monitor different parts of Geode. Geode's federated MBean architecture is scalable and allows you to have a single-agent view of a Geode distributed system.

-   **[Configuring RMI Registry Ports and RMI Connectors](../../managing/management/configuring_rmi_connector.html)**

    Geode programmatically emulates out-of-the-box JMX provided by Java and creates a JMXServiceURL with RMI Registry and RMI Connector ports on all manageable members.

-   **[Executing gfsh Commands through the Management API](../../managing/management/gfsh_and_management_api.html)**

    You can also use management APIs to execute gfsh commands programmatically.
