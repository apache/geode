<%=vars.product_name_long%> provides APIs and tools for managing your cluster and monitoring the health of your members.

-   **[Management and Monitoring Features](management_and_monitoring_features.html)**

    <%=vars.product_name_long%> uses a federated Open MBean strategy to manage and monitor all members of the cluster. This strategy gives you a consolidated, single-agent view of the cluster.

-   **[Overview of <%=vars.product_name%> Management and Monitoring Tools](mm_overview.html)**

    <%=vars.product_name%> provides a variety of management tools you can use to manage a <%=vars.product_name%> cluster.

-   **[Architecture and Components](management_system_overview.html)**

    <%=vars.product_name%>'s management and monitoring system consists of one JMX Manager node (there should only be one) and one or more managed nodes within a cluster. All members in the cluster are manageable through MBeans and <%=vars.product_name%> Management Service APIs.

-   **[JMX Manager Operations](jmx_manager_node.html#topic_36C918B4202D45F3AC225FFD23B11D7C)**

    Any member can host an embedded JMX Manager, which provides a federated view of all MBeans for the cluster. The member can be configured to be a manager at startup or anytime during its life by invoking the appropriate API calls on the ManagementService.

-   **[Federated MBean Architecture](mbean_architecture.html)**

    <%=vars.product_name%> uses MBeans to manage and monitor different parts of <%=vars.product_name%>. <%=vars.product_name%>'s federated MBean architecture is scalable and allows you to have a single-agent view of a <%=vars.product_name%> cluster.

-   **[Configuring RMI Registry Ports and RMI Connectors](configuring_rmi_connector.html)**

    <%=vars.product_name%> programmatically emulates out-of-the-box JMX provided by Java and creates a JMXServiceURL with RMI Registry and RMI Connector ports on all manageable members.

-   **[Executing gfsh Commands through the Management API](gfsh_and_management_api.html)**

    You can also use management APIs to execute gfsh commands programmatically.
