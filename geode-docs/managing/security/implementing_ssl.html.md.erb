You can configure SSL for authentication between members and to protect your data during
distribution. You can use SSL alone or in conjunction with the other Geode security options.
Geode SSL connections use the Java Secure Sockets Extension (JSSE) package.

## <a id="ssl_configurable_components" class="no-quick-link"></a>SSL-Configurable Components

You can specify that SSL be used system-wide, or you can independently configure SSL for specific
system components.  The following list shows the system components that can be separately configured
to communicate using SSL, and the kind of communications to which each component name refers:

<dt>**cluster**</dt>
<dd>Peer-to-peer communications among members of a distributed system</dd>

<dt>**gateway**</dt>
<dd>Communication across WAN gateways from one site to another</dd>

<dt>**web**</dt>
<dd>All web-based services hosted on the configured server, which can include the Developer REST API
service, the Management REST API service (used for remote cluster management) and the Pulse
monitoring tool's web-based user interface.</dd>

<dt>**jmx**</dt>
<dd>Java management extension communications, including communications with the `gfsh` utility. 
The Pulse monitoring tool uses JMX for server-side communication with a locator, but SSL
applies to this connection only if Pulse is located on an app server separate from the
locator. When Pulse and the locator are colocated, JMX communication between the two does not
involve a TCP connection, so SSL does not apply.</dd>

<dt>**locator**</dt>
<dd>Communication with and between locators</dd>

<dt>**server**</dt>
<dd>Communication between clients and servers</dd>

<dt>**all**</dt>
<dd>All of the above (use SSL system-wide)</dd>

Specifying that a component is enabled for SSL applies to the component's server-socket side and its
client-socket side.  For example, if you enable SSL for locators, then any process that communicates
with a locator must also have SSL enabled.

## <a id="ssl_configuration_properties" class="no-quick-link"></a>SSL Configuration Properties

You can use Geode configuration properties to enable or disable SSL, to identify SSL ciphers and
protocols, and to provide the location and credentials for key and trust stores.

<dt>**ssl-enabled-components**</dt>
<dd>List of components for which to enable SSL. Component list can be "all" or a comma-separated list of components.</dd>

<dt>**ssl-require-authentication**</dt>
<dd>Requires two-way authentication, applies to all components except web. Boolean - if true (the default), two-way authentication is required.</dd>

<dt>**ssl-web-require-authentication**</dt>
<dd>Requires two-way authentication for web component. Boolean - if true, two-way authentication is required. Default is false (one-way authentication only).</dd>

<dt>**ssl-default-alias**</dt>
<dd>A server uses one key store to hold its SSL certificates. All components on that server can share a
single certificate, designated by the ssl-default-alias property.  If ssl-default-alias
is not specified, the first certificate in the key store acts as the default certificate.</dd>

<dt>**ssl-_component_-alias=string**</dt>
<dd>You can configure a separate certificate for any component. All certificates reside in the same key
store, but can be designated by separate aliases that incorporate the component name, using this syntax,
where _component_ is the name of a component. When a component-specific alias is specified, it
overrides the ssl-default-alias for the _component_ specified.

For example, ssl-locator-alias would specify a name for the locator component's certificate in the system key store.</dd>

<dt>**ssl-ciphers**</dt>
<dd>A comma-separated list of the valid SSL ciphers for SSL-enabled component connections. A setting of 'any'
uses any ciphers that are enabled by default in the configured JSSE provider.</dd>

<dt>**ssl-protocols**</dt>
<dd>A comma-separated list of the valid SSL-enabled component connections. A setting of 'any' uses
any protocol that is enabled by default in the configured JSSE provider.</dd>

<dt>**ssl-keystore, ssl-keystore-password**</dt>
<dd>The path to the key store and the key store password, specified as strings</dd>

<dt>**ssl-truststore, ssl-truststore-password**</dt>
<dd>The path to the trust store and the trust store password, specified as strings</dd>

### Example: secure communications throughout

To implement secure SSL communications throughout an entire distributed system, each process should
enable SSL for all components.
 
``` pre
ssl-enabled-components=all
ssl-keystore=secure/keystore.dat
ssl-keystore-password=changeit
ssl-truststore=secure/truststore.dat
ssl-truststore-password=changeit
```
 
If the key store has multiple certificates you may want to specify the alias of the one you wish to use for each process.  For instance, `ssl-default-alias=Hiroki`.


### Example: non-secure cluster communications, secure client/server

In this example, SSL is used to secure communications between the client and the server:

**Server properties**

Cluster SSL is not enabled.

``` pre
ssl-enabled-components=server,locator
ssl-server-alias=server
ssl-keystore=secure/keystore.dat
ssl-keystore-password=changeit
ssl-truststore=secure/truststore.dat
ssl-truststore-password=changeit
ssl-default-alias=Server-Cert
```

**Locator properties**

Cluster SSL is not enabled.

``` pre
ssl-enabled-components=locator
ssl-locator-alias=locator
ssl-keystore=secure/keystore.dat
ssl-keystore-password=changeit
ssl-truststore=secure/truststore.dat
ssl-truststore-password=changeit
ssl-default-alias=Locator-Cert
```
 
**Client properties**

On the client, the list of enabled components reflects the server's configuration so the client
knows how it is expected to communicate with (for example) servers and locators.  Paths to keystore
and truststore are local to the client.

In this example, the client's trust store must trust both locator and server certificates.  Since
the client does not specify a certificate alias, SSL will use the default certificate in its key
store.

``` pre
ssl-enabled-components=server,locator
ssl-keystore=secret/keystore.dat
ssl-keystore-password=changeit
ssl-truststore=secret/truststore.dat
ssl-truststore-password=changeit
```

## <a id="implementing_ssl__sec_ssl_impl_proc" class="no-quick-link"></a>Procedure

1.  Make sure your Java installation includes the JSSE API and familiarize yourself with its
use. For information, see the [Oracle JSSE website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136007.html).

2.  Configure SSL as needed for each connection type:

    1.  Use locators for member discovery within the distributed systems and for client discovery of
    servers. See [Configuring Peer-to-Peer Discovery](../../topologies_and_comm/p2p_configuration/setting_up_a_p2p_system.html) and
    [Configuring a Client/Server System](../../topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/setting_up_a_client_server_system.html#setting_up_a_client_server_system).

    2.  Configure SSL properties as necessary for different component types, using the properties
    described above. For example, to enable SSL for
    communication between clients and servers you would configure properties in the
    `gemfire.properties` file similar to:

        ``` pre
        ssl-enabled-components=server
        ssl-protocols=any
        ssl-ciphers=SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_MD5, SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA
        ssl-keystore=/path/to/trusted.keystore
        ssl-keystore-password=password
        ssl-truststore=/path/to/trusted.keystore
        ssl-truststore-password=password
        ```
