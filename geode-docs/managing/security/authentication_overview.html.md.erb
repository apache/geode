Authentication verifies the identities of components within the
cluster such as peers, clients, and those connecting to a JMX manager.

-   **[Implementing Authentication](implementing_authentication.html)**

    All components of the cluster authenticate the same way,
    through a custom-written method.

-   **[Authentication Example](authentication_examples.html)**

    The example demonstrates the basics of an implementation of the
`SecurityManager.authenticate` method.

-   **[Implementing Authentication Expiry](implementing_authentication_expiry.html)**

    Client credentials can be given a limited life time to enhance the security of the cluster.
