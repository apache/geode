The security framework permits authentication of connecting components and authorization of operations for all communicating components of the cluster.

-   **[Security Implementation Introduction and Overview](implementing_security.html)**

    Encryption, SSL secure communication, authentication, and authorization help to secure the cluster.

-   **[Security Detail Considerations](security_audit_overview.html)**

    This section gathers discrete details in one convenient location to better help you assess and configure the security of your environment.

-   **[Enable Security with Property Definitions](enable_security.html)**

-   **[Authentication](authentication_overview.html)**

    A cluster using authentication bars malicious peers or clients, and deters inadvertent access to its cache.

-   **[Authorization](authorization_overview.html)**

    Client operations on a cache server can be restricted or completely blocked based on the roles and permissions assigned to the credentials submitted by the client.

-   **[Post Processing of Region Data](post_processing.html)**

-   **[SSL](ssl_overview.html)**

    SSL protects your data in transit between applications.
