This example demonstrates the basics of an implementation of the
`SecurityManager.authorize` method.
The remainder of the example may be found within the Apache Geode
source code within the
`geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/security/templates` directory.

Of course, the security implementation of every installation is unique,
so this example cannot be used in a production environment,
as the roles and permissions will not match the needs of any
real distributed system. 

This example assumes that a set of users, a set of roles
that a user might take on within the system,
and a mapping of users to their roles are described
in a JSON format file.
The roles define a set of authorized resource permissions granted
for users in those roles.
Code not shown here parses the file to compose a data structure
with the information on roles and users.
The `authorize` callback denies permission for any operation
that does not have a principal representing the identity of the
operation's requester.
Given the principal, 
the method iterates through the data structure searching for the 
necessary permissions for the principal.
When the necessary permission is found, 
authorization is granted by returning the value `true`.
If the permission is not found in the data structure,
then the method returns `false`, denying authorization of the operation.

``` pre
public boolean authorize(final Object principal, final ResourcePermission context) {
    if (principal == null) return false;

    User user = this.userNameToUser.get(principal.toString());
    if (user == null) return false; // this user is not authorized to do anything

    // check if the user has this permission defined in the context
    for (Role role : this.userNameToUser.get(user.name).roles) {
        for (Permission permitted : role.permissions) {
            if (permitted.implies(context)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```
