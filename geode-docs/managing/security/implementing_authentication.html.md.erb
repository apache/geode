Authentication lends a measure of security to a distributed system
by verifying the identity of components as they connect to the system.
All components use the same authentication mechanism.

## How Authentication Works

When a component initiates a connection to the distributed system,
the `SecurityManager.authenticate` method is invoked.
The component provides its credentials in the form of properties
as a parameter to the `authenticate` method.
The credential is presumed to be the two properties:
`security-username` and `security-password`.
The `authenticate` method is expected to either return an object
representing a principal or throw an `AuthenticationFailedException`.

A well-designed `authenticate` method will have or will have a way of
obtaining a set of known user and password pairs that can be compared
to the credential presented.

## How a Server Sets Its Credential

In order to connect with a locator that does authentication,
a server will need to set its credential, composed of the two properties
`security-username` and `security-password`.
There are two ways of accomplishing this:

- Set the `security-username` and `security-password` in the server's
`gfsecurity.properties` file that will be read upon server start up,
as in the example

     ``` pre
     security-username=admin
     security-password=xyz1234
     ```
The user name and password are stored in the clear, so the
`gfsecurity.properties` file must be protected by restricting access with
file system permissions.

- Implement the `getCredentials` method of the `AuthInitialize` interface
for the server.
This callback's location is defined in the property `security-peer-auth-init`,
as in the example

     ``` pre
     security-peer-auth-init=com.example.security.MyAuthInitialize
     ```
The implementation of `getCredentials` may then acquire values for
the properties `security-username` and `security-password` in whatever way
it wishes.
It might look up values in a database or another external resource.

Gateway senders and receivers communicate as a component of their
server member.
Therefore, the credential of the server become those of the gateway
sender or receiver.

## How a Cache Client Sets Its Credential

<!--  Revised for GEODE-1883
In order to connect with a locator or a server that does authentication,
a client will need to set its credential, composed of the two properties
`security-username` and `security-password`.
There are two ways of accomplishing this:

- Set the `security-username` and `security-password` in the client's
`gfsecurity.properties` file that will be read upon client start up,
as in the example

     ``` pre
     security-username=clientapp
     security-password=xyz1234
     ```
The user name and password are stored in the clear, so the
`gfsecurity.properties` file must be protected by restricting access with
file system permissions.
To accomplish this:

- Implement the `getCredentials` method of the `AuthInitialize` interface
for the client.
This callback's location is defined in the property `security-client-auth-init`,
as in the example

     ``` pre
     security-client-auth-init=com.example.security.ClientAuthInitialize
     ```
The implementation of `getCredentials` may then acquire values for
the properties `security-username` and `security-password` in whatever way
it wishes.
It might look up values in a database or another external resource,
or it might prompt for values.

## How Other Components Set Their Credentials

`gfsh` prompts for the user name and password upon invocation of
a`gfsh connect` command.

Pulse prompts for the user name and password upon start up.

Due to the stateless nature of the REST API,
a web application or other component that speaks to a server or locator
via the REST API goes through authentication on each request.
The header of the request needs to include attributes that define values for
`security-username` and `security-password`.

## Implement SecurityManager Interface

Complete these items to implement authentication done by either a
locator or a server.

- Decide upon an authentication algorithm.
The [Authentication Example](authentication_examples.html)
stores a set of user name and
password pairs that represent the identities of components
that will connect to the system.
This simplistic algorithm returns the user name as a principal
if the user name and password passed to the `authenticate` method
are a match for one of the stored pairs.
- Define the `security-manager` property.
See [Enable Security with Property Definitions](enable_security.html)
for details about this property.
- Implement the  `authenticate` method of the `SecurityManager` interface.
- Define any extra resources that the implemented authentication algorithm
needs in order to make a decision.
