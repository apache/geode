Authentication expiry makes it possible for cluster administrators to limit the life span of client
and peer connections within the cluster. The use of expirable credentials is most common when used in
combination with token based authentication and authorization.

Client connections are notified of expiry through the throwing of an `AuthenticationExpiredException`
which is thrown in the implementations of `SecurityManager.authenticate` or `SecurityManager.authorize`.

Clients will do one automatic attempt to reconnect. Upon receiving a second `AuthenticationExpiredException`
the exception will be propagated up the chain for the user to handle. There are some differences in
behavior between older and newer clients.

**Support for Automatic	Reconnect**

Client version | single user ops | multi user ops | single user CQ/RI | multi user CQ/RI
--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
Geode 1.15 and later | Y  | Y  | Y | N
older than Geode 1.15 | Y  | Y  | N | N

``` pre
Y = supported
N = not supported
```

Clients older than version 1.15 will also be able to do an automatic reconnect unless the connection
is one of the following types where the exception will always be propagated up the chain:

* multi-user client mode
* event-dispatching (CQ and registered interest)

## <a id="authentication_expiry_considerations"></a>Authentication Expiry Considerations

The common cycle for authentication and authorization is the following:

```pre
AuthInitialize.getCredentials(...) -> SecurityManager.authenticate(...) -> SecurityManager.authorize(...)
```

Where `AuthInitialize.getCredentials()` provides the `security properties` for `SecurityManager.authenticate()`
which in turn provides the `principal object` for `SecurityManager.authorize()`. It's important to
understand that some time will pass between the `AuthInitialize.getCredentials()` call and the
`SecurityManager.authorize()` call. The specific amount of time depends on the implementation and
runtime environment details.

In case of the use of an external token provider we assume that this token provider will be asked for
a token in the `AuthInitialize.getCredentials()` call. A token provider can return existing tokens for
a given user so it is recommended that implementers of the `AuthInitialize` and `SecurityManager`
interfaces take imminent timeout and token refresh in consideration to avoid receiving multiple
unintended `AuthenticationExpiredException`s in a row and having to deal with the propagation of these
exceptions.
