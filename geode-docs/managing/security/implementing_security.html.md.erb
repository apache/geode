## Security Features

Encryption, SSL secure communication, authentication, and authorization 
features help to secure the distributed system.

Security features include:

-   **A single security interface for all components**. The single
authentication and authorization mechanism simplifies the security
implementation.
It views and interacts with all components in a consistent manner. 
-   **System-wide role-based access control**.
Roles regiment authorized operations requested by the various components.
-   **SSL communication**. Allows configuration of connections to be 
SSL-based, rather than plain socket connections.
You can enable SSL separately for peer-to-peer, client, JMX, gateway senders and receivers, and HTTP connections.
-   **Post processing of region data**. Return values for operations that
return region values may be formatted.

## Overview

An authentication and authorization mechanism forms the core of
the internal security of the distributed system.
Communications may be further protected by enabling SSL for
data in transit.

Authentication verifies the identity of communicating components,
leading to control over participation.
The variety of participants include peer members, servers,
clients, originators of JMX operations, Pulse,
gateway senders and receivers representing WAN members of the system,
and commands arriving from `gfsh` on behalf of system users
or administrators.

Connection requests trigger the invocation of an authentication
callback.
This special-purpose callback is written as part of the application,
and it attempts to authenticate the requester by whatever
algorithm it chooses. 
The result is either a returned principal representing the requester's
authenticated identity or an exception indicating that the requester
has not been authenticated.
The principal becomes part of any request for operations,
which go through the authorization process.


Given authentication,
isolation and access to cache data and system state can be further
protected by implementing the authorization mechanism,
also implemented as a special-purpose callback as part of the application.
For example, the protection may be to permit only certain system administrators
to start and stop servers. 
The authority to do this needs to be limited to specific
verified accounts, preventing those without the authorization. 
An implementation of the authorization callback will require
that an authenticate identity accompanies all requests to the system,
and that the system maintains a representation of which identities
are permitted to complete which actions or cache commands.
