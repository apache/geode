Every application and server in a cluster can access statistical data about <%=vars.product_name_long%> operations. You can configure the gathering of statistics by using the `alter runtime` command of `gfsh` or in the `gemfire.properties` file to facilitate system analysis and troubleshooting.

-   **[How Statistics Work](how_statistics_work.html)**

    Each application or cache server that joins the cluster can collect and archive statistical data for analyzing system performance.

-   **[Transient Region and Entry Statistics](transient_region_and_entry_statistics.html)**

    For replicated, distributed, and local regions, <%=vars.product_name%> provides a standard set of statistics for the region and its entries.

-   **[Application-Defined and Custom Statistics](application_defined_statistics.html)**
