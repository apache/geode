Comprehensive logging messages help you confirm system configuration and debug problems in configuration and code.

-   **[How Geode Logging Works](../../managing/logging/how_logging_works.html)**

    Apache Geode uses Apache Log4j 2 as the basis for its logging system.

-   **[Understanding Log Messages and Their Categories](../../managing/logging/logging_categories.html)**

    System logging messages typically pertain to startup; logging management; connection and system membership; distribution; or cache, region, and entry management.

-   **[Naming, Searching, and Creating Log Files](../../managing/logging/logging_whats_next.html)**

    The best way to manage and understand the logs is to have each member log to its own files.

-   **[Set Up Logging](../../managing/logging/setting_up_logging.html)**

    You configure logging in a member's `gemfire.properties` or at startup with `gfsh`.

-   **[Advanced Usersâ€”Configuring Log4j 2 for Geode](../../managing/logging/configuring_log4j2.html)**

    Basic Geode logging configuration is configured via the gemfire.properties file. This topic is intended for advanced users who need increased control over logging due to integration with third-party libraries.

-   **[Log Collection Utility](../../managing/logging/log_collection_utility.html)**

    To aid in the troubleshooting of Apache Geode issues, you can use the provided log collection utility to gather and upload log files and other troubleshooting artifacts. This tool is only supported on Linux machines.
