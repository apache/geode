Apache Geode Developer REST APIs are integrated with the Swaggerâ„¢ framework. This framework provides a browser-based test client that allows you to visualize and try out Geode REST APIs.

Swagger application JARs are included in the Geode REST application WAR; you do not need to install any additional libraries to use Swagger.

The following example demonstrates how to access the Swagger UI to browse the APIs.

1.  Start a Geode Developer REST API-enabled server and JMX Manager as described in [Setup and Configuration](setup_config.html#topic_e21_qc5_m4). For example:

    ``` pre
    gfsh>start server --name=server1  --J=-Dgemfire.start-dev-rest-api=true \
    --J=-Dgemfire.http-service-bind-address=localhost \
    --J=-Dgemfire.jmx-manager=true --J=-Dgemfire.jmx-manager-start=true
    ```

    If desired, you can specify a different HTTP port for the developer REST service. For example, `-J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=8080`. If you do not specify this property, the service is available at the default port 7070.

2.  To access Swagger, open a browser and enter the following URL: For example:

    ``` pre
    http://localhost:7070/gemfire-api/docs/index.html
    ```

    The following Web page appears: <img src="../images/swagger_home.png" id="concept_rlr_y3c_54__image_m15_qcm_x4" class="image" />

3.  In gfsh, connect to the server running the JMX Manager.

    ``` pre
    gfsh>connect --jmx-manager=localhost[1099]
    ```

4.  Using gfsh, create one or more regions on the REST API server. For example:

    ``` pre
    gfsh>create region --name=region1 --type=REPLICATE --key-constraint=java.lang.String
    Member  | Status
    ------- | ------------------------------------------
    server1 | Region "/region1" created on "server1"
    ```

5.  In Swagger, click on **region : region** to list all the available endpoints for accessing regions.
6.  In the list of **region** endpoints, click on the **GET /v1** endpoint link. The page displays additional request and response information about the API. <img src="../images/swagger_v1.png" id="concept_rlr_y3c_54__image_kx2_2dm_x4" class="image" />
7.  Click the **Try it out!** button. Any regions you added in step 5 are returned in the response body. <img src="../images/swagger_v1_response.png" id="concept_rlr_y3c_54__image_y2p_tdm_x4" class="image" />
8.  Add an entry to the region by expanding the **POST /v1/{region}** endpoint. <img src="../images/swagger_post_region.png" id="concept_rlr_y3c_54__image_sfk_c2m_x4" class="image" />
9.  Click the **Try it out!** button to see the response body and response code. <img src="../images/swagger_post_region_response.png" id="concept_rlr_y3c_54__image_pmx_k2m_x4" class="image" />

You can use the Swagger interface to try out additional Geode API endpoints and view sample responses.
