Update a named, parameterized query.

```

## Parameters

<table>

**Note:**
For this release, you cannot specify the query string inside the request body (as JSON). You must specify the query as a URL parameter.

PUT /gemfire-api/v1/queries/selectOrders?q="SELECT DISTINCT from /customers where lastName=$1"

Accept: application/json
Content-Length: <#-of-bytes>
```

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<td>Error encountered at Geode server. Check the HTTP response body for a stack trace of the exception.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Implementation Notes

This operation is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests should have the same effect as the initial request.
