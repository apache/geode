This section summarizes all available Apache Geode REST API resources and endpoints.

**Note:**
This documentation covers the **v1** release of Geode REST APIs for developing applications.

-   **[Region Endpoints](rest_regions.html)**

    A Geode region is how Geode logically groups data within its cache. Regions stores data as entries, which are key-value pairs. Using the REST APIs you can read, add (or update), and delete region data.

-   **[Query Endpoints](rest_queries.html)**

    Geode uses a query syntax based on OQL (Object Query Language) to query region data. Since Geode regions are key-value stores, values can range from simple byte arrays to complex nested objects.

-   **[Function Endpoints](rest_functions.html)**

    Geode functions allows you to write and execute server-side transactions and data operations. These may include anything ranging from initializing components or third-party services or aggregating data.

-   **[Administrative Endpoints](rest_admin.html)**

    Administrative endpoints provide management and monitoring functionality for the REST API interface.
