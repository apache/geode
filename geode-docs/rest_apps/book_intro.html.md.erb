*Developing REST Applications for Apache Geode* provides background and instructions on how to program REST applications with Apache Geode. Geode REST APIs allow you to access region data, queries and functions in your Geode deployment in wide variety of programming languages.

**Note:**
This documentation covers the **v1** release of Geode REST APIs for developing applications.

-   **[Geode REST API Overview](../rest_apps/chapter_overview.html)**

    By using the Geode REST application interface, you can immediately access Geode's data management capabilities in languages other than the natively supported Java language.

-   **[Prerequisites and Limitations for Writing REST Applications](../rest_apps/rest_prereqs.html)**

    Before development, understand the prerequisites and limitations of the current REST implementation in Geode.

-   **[Setup and Configuration](../rest_apps/setup_config.html)**

    The Apache Geode developer REST interface runs as an embedded HTTP or HTTPS service (Jetty server) within a Geode data node.

-   **[Using the Swagger UI to Browse REST APIs](../rest_apps/using_swagger.html)**

    Apache Geode Developer REST APIs are integrated with the Swaggerâ„¢ framework. This framework provides a browser-based test client that allows you to visualize and try out Geode REST APIs.

-   **[Developing REST Applications](../rest_apps/develop_rest_apps.html)**

    This section provides guidelines on writing REST client applications for Geode.

-   **[Sample REST Applications](../rest_apps/rest_examples.html)**

    This section provides examples that illustrate how multiple clients, both REST and native, can access the same Geode region data.

-   **[Troubleshooting and FAQ](../rest_apps/troubleshooting.html)**

    This section provides troubleshooting guidance and frequently asked questions about Geode Developer REST APIs.

-   **[Apache Geode REST API Reference](../rest_apps/rest_api_reference.html)**

    This section summarizes all available Apache Geode REST API resources and endpoints.
