This section describes the primary statistics gathered by <%=vars.product_name%> when statistics are enabled.

All statistics gathering requires the `gemfire.properties` `statistic-sampling-enabled` in `gemfire.properties` file to be true. Statistics that use time require the `gemfire.properties` `enable-time-statistics` to be true.

Performance statistics are collected for each Java application or cache server that connects to a distributed system.

## <a id="section_DEF8D3644D3246AB8F06FE09A37DC5C8" class="no-quick-link"></a>Cache Performance (CachePerfStats)

Statistics for the <%=vars.product_name%> cache. These can be used to determine the type and number of cache operations being performed and how much time they consume.

Regarding <%=vars.product_name%> cache transactions, transaction-related statistics are compiled and stored as properties in the CachePerfStats statistic resource. Because the transaction’s data scope is the cache, these statistics are collected on a per-cache basis.

The primary statistics are:

| Statistic                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `conflatedEvents`                | The number of events that were conflated, and not delivered to event listeners or gateway senders on this member. Events are typically conflated because a later event was already applied to the cache, or because a concurrent event was ignored to ensure cache consistency. Note that some members may discard an update while other members apply the update, depending on the order in which each member receives the update. For this reason, the `conflatedEvents` statistic will differ for each <%=vars.product_name%> member.

## Distribution Statistics Related to Slow Receivers

The distribution statistics provide statistics pertaining to slow receivers. The primary statistics are:

| Statistic                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `asyncDistributionTimeoutExceeded` | Incremented every time an asyncSocketWrite has exceeded async-distribution-timeout and an async queue has been created.                                                                               |
| `asyncQueue*`                      | Provide information about queues the producer is managing for its consumers. There are no statistics maintained for individual consumers. The following are the primary statistics of this type.      |
| `asyncQueues`                      | Indicates the number of queues currently in the producer.                                                                                                                                             |
| `asyncQueueSizeExceeded`           | Incremented every time a queue has exceeded `async-max-queue-size` and the receiver has been sent a disconnect message.                                                                               |
| `asyncQueueTimeoutExceeded`        | Incremented every time a queue flushing has exceeded `async-queue-timeout` and the receiver has been sent a disconnect message.                                                                       |

# Partitioned Regions (PartitionedRegion&lt;partitioned\_region\_name&gt;Statistics)

**Partitioned Region Statistics on Region Operations**

These statistics track the standard region operations executed in the member. Operations can originate locally or in a request from a remote member.

**Note:**
Unsuccessful operations are not counted in these statistics.

The primary statistics are:

</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Statistic</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code class="ph codeph">actualRedundantCopies</code></td>
<td>The least current redundant number of copies for any data in this partitioned region (there may be some data that is fully redundant, but some data will have only this number of copies). This value may drop when a data store is lost or rise when a data store is added. This value may drop temporarily during partitioned region creation or destruction and then rise again.
<div class="note note">
<b>Note:</b>
<p>If this value remains low, then partitioned region data is at risk and may be lost if another data store is lost.</p>
</div>
A healthy partitioned region will maintain a value equal to configuredRedundantCopies. The user should add one or more data stores if the value remains low. High-availability may result in a brief fluctuation, but it should return to a value equal to configuredRedundantCopies if there are sufficient data stores present (that is, killing one data store will cause its data to fail over to another data store).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code class="ph codeph">configuredRedundantCopies</code></td>
<td>This is equivalent to the PartitionAttributes.getRedundantCopies configuration that was used to create this partitioned region. This value remains unchanged for a given partitioned region.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code class="ph codeph">lowRedundancyBucketCount</code></td>
<td>The number of buckets in this partitioned region that currently have fewer copies than the configuredRedundantCopies. This value may rise above zero when a data store is lost and return to zero when one or more data stores are added. This value may rise temporarily during partitioned region creation or destruction and then return to zero.
<div class="note note">
<b>Note:</b>
<p>If this value remains above zero, then partitioned region data is at risk and may be lost if another data store is lost.</p>

This value will be above zero whenever actualRedundantCopies is less than configuredRedundantCopies. A healthy partitioned region will maintain a value of zero. The user should add one or more datstores if this value remains above zero.

| `messagesNotQueuedConflated`     | Number of client operations messages received but not added to the subscription queue because the queue already contains a message with the message's key.                           |
| `messagesNotQueuedNotInterested` | Number of client operations messages received but not added to the subscription queue because the client represented by the receiving proxy was not interested in the message's key. |
| `messagesNotQueuedOriginator`    | Number of client operations messages received but not added to the subscription queue, because the receiving proxy represents the client originating the message.                    |
| `messagesProcessed`              | Number of client operations messages removed from the subscription queue and sent.                                                                                                   |

Collected in the server, these statistics track event messages queued on the server to be sent to the client. The statistics are gathered for each client subscription queue and are incremental for the lifetime of the queue. The event messages are referred to as events in these statistics. The primary statistics are:

| Statistic             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `eventsConflated`     | Number of events conflated. If this is high, the server's dispatcher may be running slowly. This could be caused by one or more slow client.s causing blocking in their subscription queues.                                               |
| `eventsExpired`       | Number of events that have expired while in the subscription queue. If this is high on a secondary server, it might be that the MessageSyncInterval on the primary is set too high, causing the secondary to fall behind in event cleanup. |
| `eventsQueued`        | Number of events placed in the subscription queue.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `eventsRemoved`       | Number of events removed from the subscription queue.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `eventsRemovedByQrm`  | Number of events removed based on a message sent from the primary. Only incremented while the subscription queue is in a secondary server.                                                                                                 |
| `eventsTaken`         | Number of events taken from the subscription queue.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `numSequenceViolated` | Number of events that had sequence ID less than or equal to the last sequence ID. The system assumes these events are duplicates and does not add them to the subscription queue. A non-zero value may indicate message loss.              |
| `numVoidRemovals`     | Number of events which were supposed to be destroyed from the subscription queue through remove but were removed by some other operation like conflation or expiration.                                                                    |
| `threadIdentifiers`   | Number of ThreadIdentifier objects (units) in the subscription queue.                                                                                                                                                                      |
