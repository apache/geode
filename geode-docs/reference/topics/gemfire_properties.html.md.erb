You use the `gemfire.properties` settings to join a distributed system and configure system member behavior. Distributed system members include applications, the cache server, the locator, and other <%=vars.product_name%> processes.

You can place any security-related (properties that begin with `security-*`) configuration properties in `gemfire.properties` into a separate `gfsecurity.properties` file. Placing these configuration settings in a separate file allows you to restrict access to security configuration data. This way, you can still allow read or write access for your `gemfire.properties` file.

You can also define provider-specific properties ("ssl" properties) in `gfsecurity.properties` instead of defining them at the command-line or in your environment.

You can specify non-ASCII text in your properties files by using Unicode escape sequences. See [Using Non-ASCII Strings in <%=vars.product_name_long%> Property Files](non-ascii_strings_in_config_files.html) for more details.

**Note:**
Unless otherwise indicated, these settings only affect activities within this distributed system - not activities between clients and servers or between a gateway sender and gateway receiver in a multi-site installation.
