Build from source or use the ZIP or TAR distribution to install Apache Geode on every physical and virtual machine that will run Apache Geode.

## Build from Source on Unix

1.  Set the JAVA\_HOME environment variable.

    ``` pre
    JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_60
    export JAVA_HOME
    ```

2.  Download the project source from the Releases page found at [http://geode.incubator.apache.org](http://geode.incubator.apache.org/), and unpack the source code.
3.  Within the directory containing the unpacked source code, build without tests:

    ``` pre
    $ ./gradlew build -Dskip.tests=true
    ```

    Or, build with the tests:

    ``` pre
    $ ./gradlew build 
    ```

4.  Verify the installation by invoking `gfsh` to print version information and exit. On Linux/Unix platforms, the version will be similar to:

    ``` pre
    $ cd geode-assembly/build/install/apache-geode
    $ bin/gfsh version
    v1.0.0-incubating
    ```

## Build from Source on Windows

1.  Set the JAVA\_HOME environment variable. For example:

    ``` pre
    $ set JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_60" 
    ```

2.  Install Gradle, version 2.3 or a more recent version.
3.  Download the project source from the Releases page found at [http://geode.incubator.apache.org](http://geode.incubator.apache.org/), and unpack the source code.
4.  Within the folder containing the unpacked source code, build without the tests:

    ``` pre
    $ gradle build -Dskip.tests=true
    ```

    Or, build with the tests:

    ``` pre
    $ gradle build
    ```

5.  Verify the installation by invoking `gfsh` to print version information and exit.

    ``` pre
    $ cd geode-assembly\build\install\apache-geode\bin
    $ gfsh.bat version
    v1.0.0-incubating
    ```

1.  Download the .zip or .tar file from the Releases page found at [http://geode.incubator.apache.org](http://geode.incubator.apache.org/).
2.  Unzip the .zip file or expand the .tar file, where `path_to_product` is an absolute path, and the file name will vary due to the version number. For the .zip format:

    ``` pre
    $ unzip apache-geode-1.0.0-incubating.zip -d path_to_product
    ```

    For the .tar format:

    ``` pre
    $ tar -xvf apache-geode-1.0.0-incubating.tar -C path_to_product
    ```

3.  Set the JAVA\_HOME environment variable. On Linux/Unix platforms:

    ``` pre
    JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_60
    export JAVA_HOME
    ```

    On Windows platforms:

    ``` pre
    set JAVA_HOME=c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_60 
    ```

4.  Add the Geode scripts to your PATH environment variable. On Linux/Unix platforms:

    ``` pre
    PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:path_to_product/bin
    export PATH
    ```

    On Windows platforms:

    ``` pre
    set PATH=%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;path_to_product\bin 
    ```

5.  To verify the installation, type `gfsh version` at the command line and note that the output lists the installed version of Geode. For example:

    ``` pre
    $ gfsh version
    v1.0.0-incubating
    ```

    For more detailed version information such as the date of the build, build number and JDK version being used, invoke:

    ``` pre
    $ gfsh version --full
    ```
