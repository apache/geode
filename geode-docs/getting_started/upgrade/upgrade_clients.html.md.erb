title:  Upgrading Clients
---

When you upgrade your <%=vars.product_name%> server software, you will likely need to update your client applications in order to maintain
compatibility with the upgraded servers. To support real-world implementations, servers can usually interoperate with a few
different versions of the client software. In general, you will have best performance and reliability if:

- All clients run the same version of the client software.
- Clients and servers both run the latest versions of their respective software.

Changes you may need to make when you update, recompile, and link your client code include:

- Removing or replacing obsolete identifiers
- Reinstating secure client/server messaging

Review the Release Notes for a list of classes, methods, and other identifiers that are no longer present in the current release.
Update client code so it no longer uses any of these removed identifiers.
