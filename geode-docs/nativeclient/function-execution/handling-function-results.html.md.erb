title:  Programming to Get Function Results
---

Geode provides a default result collector. If you need special results handling, code a custom `ResultsCollector` implementation to replace the provided default. Use the `Execution::withCollector` method to define your custom collector.

**Note:**
This section applies only to functions that return results.

To program your client to get the results from a function, use the result collector returned from the function execution, like this:

``` pre
ResultCollectorPtr rc = FunctionService::onRegion(region)
                    ->withArgs(args)
                    ->withFilter(keySet)
                    ->withCollector(new MyCustomResultCollector())
                    .execute(Function);
CacheableVectorPtr functionResult = rc.getResult(); 
```

The `getResult` methods of the Geode default result collector block until all results are received, then return the full result set.

You can handle the results in a custom manner if you wish. To do this:

1.  Write a class that extends `ResultCollector` and code the methods to handle the results as you need. The methods are of two types: one handles data and information from Geode and populates the results set, while the other returns the compiled results to the calling application:

    1.  `addResult` is called by Geode when results arrive from the `Function` methods. Use `addResult` to add a single result to the ResultCollector.
    2.  `endResults` is called by Geode to signal the end of all results from the function execution.
    3.  `getResult` is available to your executing application (the one that calls `Execution.execute`) to retrieve the results. This may block until all results are available.
    4.  `clearResults` is called by Geode to clear partial results from the results collector. This is used only for highly available `onRegion` functions where the calling application waits for the results. If the call fails, before Geode retries the execution, it calls `clearResults` to ready the instance for a clean set of results.

2.  Use the `Execution` object in your executing member to call `withCollector`, passing your custom collector, as shown in the example above.
