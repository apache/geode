title:  Configuring the Native Client Cache
---

*Configuring the Native Client Cache* describes the native client cache functionality, initialization file, and APIs. It provides information about creating and working with caches, cache regions, and region entries.

The native client cache provides a framework for native clients to store, manage, and distribute application data.

-   **[Caches](../../nativeclient/client-cache/caches.html)**

    The cache is the entry point to native client data caching in Geode. Through the cache, native clients gain access to the Geode caching framework for data loading, distribution, and maintenance.

-   **[Cache Initialization File (cache.xml)](../../nativeclient/cache-init-file/chapter-overview.html)**

    To ease the task of managing the structure of the cache, you can define the default Geode cache structure in an XML-based initialization file.

-   **[Regions](../../nativeclient/client-cache/regions.html)**

    You create cache regions either programmatically or through declarative statements in the `cache.xml` file. Generally, a cache is organized and populated through a combination of the two approaches.

-   **[Region Entries](../../nativeclient/client-cache/entries.html)**

    Region entries hold cached application data. Entries are automatically managed according to region attribute settings.

-   **[Region Consistency](../../nativeclient/client-cache/consistency_checking_in_regions.html)**

    Geode ensures that all copies of a region eventually reach a consistent state on all members and clients that host the region.

-   **[Region Attributes](../../nativeclient/client-cache/region-attributes.html)**

    Region attributes govern the automated management of a region and its entries.

-   **[Cache Management](../../nativeclient/client-cache/cache-management.html)**

    This section covers cache management.
