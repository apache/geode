Use peer-to-peer configuration to set member discovery and communication within a single cluster.

-   **[Configuring Peer-to-Peer Discovery](setting_up_a_p2p_system.html)**

    Peer members discover each other using one or more locators.

-   **[Configuring Peer Communication](setting_up_peer_communication.html)**

    By default <%=vars.product_name_long%> uses TCP for communication between members of a single cluster. You can modify this at the member and region levels.

-   **[Organizing Peers into Logical Member Groups](configuring_peer_member_groups.html)**

    In a peer-to-peer configuration, you can organize members into logical member groups and use those groups to associate specific data or assign tasks to a pre-defined set of members.
