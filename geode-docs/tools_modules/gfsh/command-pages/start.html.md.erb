## <a id="topic_AB8BA3F42B9645A8BE9BD97CE2F839A8" class="no-quick-link"></a>start gateway-sender

Start the gateway sender on a member or members.

For information on how to configure a gateway sender, see [Configure Gateway Senders](../../../topologies_and_comm/multi_site_configuration/setting_up_a_multisite_system.html#setting_up_a_multisite_system__section_1500299A8F9A4C2385680E337F5D3DEC).

Note: By default, gateway senders are configured to start automatically. Manual restart introduces a risk of data loss; it is not intended for production systems.

**Availability:** Online. You must be connected in `gfsh` to a JMX Manager member to use this command.

## <a id="topic_D00507416F3944DFAB48D2FA2B9E4A31" class="no-quick-link"></a>start jconsole

Start the JDK JConsole monitoring application in a separate process.

JConsole automatically connects to a running JMX Manager node if one is available.

Note that you must have a JDK installed (not just a JRE) and the correct PATH and JAVA\_HOME environment variables set.

See [Browsing <%=vars.product_name%> MBeans through JConsole](../../../managing/management/mbeans_jconsole.html) for an example of using JConsole with the <%=vars.product_name%> management and monitoring system.

**Availability:** Online or offline.

**Syntax:**

``` pre
start jconsole [--interval=<seconds>] [--notile] [--version]
[--J<jconsole JVM options>]
```

**Parameters, start jconsole**

| Name             | Description    | Default Value |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| \\-\\-interval   | Set the update interval to n seconds (default is 4 seconds). (Equivalent to JConsole's `-interval=n`) | 4 |
| \\-\\-notile     | Whether to initially tile windows for two or more connections. This parameter is passed as `-notile` to JConsole. | false |
| &#8209;&#8209;pluginpath | Directories or JAR files which are searched for JConsole plugins. The path should contain a provider-configuration file named:`META-INF/services/com.sun.tools.jconsole.JConsolePlugin` containing one line for each plugin specifying the fully qualified class name of the class implementing the `com.sun.tools.jconsole.JConsolePlugin` class. | |
| \\-\\-version    | Display the JConsole version information. This parameter is passed as `-version` to JConsole. | false |
| \\-\\-J          | Arguments passed to the JVM on which JConsole runs | |

**Example Commands:**

``` pre
gfsh>start jconsole --interval=8 --notile;
Running JDK JConsole

gfsh>start jconsole --version;
JConsole version "1.8.0_31-b01-1"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_31-b01-1-11)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.6-b01-11, mixed mode)
```

**Sample Output:**

``` pre
gfsh>start jconsole
Running JDK JConsole
```

The JConsole application appears and auto-connects to a JMX Manager node if one is available:

## <a id="topic_5B5BF8BEE905463D8B7762B89E2D65E7" class="no-quick-link"></a>start jvisualvm

Start the JDK's Java VisualVM monitoring application in a separate process.

**Availability:** Online or offline.

**Syntax:**

``` pre
start jvisualvm [--J=value(,value)*]
```

**Parameters, start jvisualvm**

| Name       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| \\-\\-J    | VM-option passed to the spawned CacheServer VM.<br/>For example: `--J=-Dfoo.bar=true` for setting foo.bar to 'true'. |

**Example Commands:**

``` pre

**Sample Output:** <img src="../../../images/jvisualvm.png" id="topic_5B5BF8BEE905463D8B7762B89E2D65E7__image_BDA0F3A31F784C5FBBB5999EDA2BD942" class="image" />

## <a id="topic_591260CF25D64562A0EDD7260D2AC6D4" class="no-quick-link"></a>start locator

Start a locator.

The command creates a subdirectory and log file named after the locator. If the locator detects that no other JMX Manager exists, then the locator will automatically start an embedded JMX Manager and connect the current `gfsh` session to the JMX Manager.

**Note:** You must have `JAVA_HOME` set before starting gfsh to use this command.

In addition, if gfsh is not already connected to a JMX Manager, the gfsh console will automatically connect to the new embedded JMX Manager started by the new locator.

**Note:** When both `--max-heap` and `--initial-heap` are specified during locator startup, additional GC parameters are specified internally by <%=vars.product_name%>'s Resource Manager. If you do not want the additional default GC properties set by the Resource Manager, then use the`-Xms` and `-Xmx` JVM options. See [Controlling Heap Use with the Resource Manager](../../../managing/heap_use/heap_management.html#configuring_resource_manager) for more information.

**Note:** The additional GC parameters introduced by the `--max-heap` option are not compatible with the usage of G1 garbage collector.

**Availability:** Online or offline.

**Syntax:**

``` pre
start locator --name=value [--bind-address=value] [--force(=value)]
 [--groups=value(,value)*] [--hostname-for-clients=value] [--classpath=value]
 [--locators=value] [--log-level=value] [--mcast-address=value] [--mcast-port=value] [--port=value] [--dir=value]
 [--properties-file=value] [--security-properties-file=value] [--initial-heap=value] [--max-heap=value]
 [--connect(=value)] [--enable-cluster-configuration(=value)] [--load-cluster-configuration-from-dir(=value)]
 [--cluster-config-dir=value] [--redirect-output(=value)]
 [--http-service-port=value] [--http-service-bind-address=value] 
 [--J=value(,value)*]

Past the threshold, operations that require heap space will throw a `LowMemoryException`. This feature requires additional VM flags to perform properly; you must set `--initial-heap` and `--max-heap` or the corresponding JVM properties to use this threshold. You must also set `--max-heap` and `--initial-heap` to the same value.</p>|0 (no critical heap threshold enforced)|
| \\-\\-critical-off-heap-percentage    | The percentage of off-heap memory used at or above which the cache is considered in danger of becoming inoperable due to out of memory exceptions.

| \\-\\-hostname-for-clients            | Sets the IP address or host name that a locator will provide to clients. Clients use the address to connect to a server. Set this value when clients use a different address to connect with the server than the `bind-address`, as those clients might with servers in a private cloud or multi-homed environment. Not specifying this option or setting this option to the empty string (&quot;&quot;) causes the `bind-address` to be given to clients.| |

| \\-\\-socket-buffer-size              | Sets the buffer size in bytes of the socket connection for this CacheServer. The default is 32768 bytes.| |
| \\-\\-lock-memory                     | (Linux only) When true, the member's heap and off-heap memory are locked in RAM, preventing them from being paged to disk. You must increase the related `ulimit` operating system resource to allow the OS to lock memory chunks of sufficient size.| false |
| \\-\\-off-heap-memory-size            | The integer quantity of off-heap memory to be used for storing region values. Specified in Gigabytes with a 'g' suffix, or Megabytes with an 'm' suffix. For example, allocate a 2 Gigabyte off-heap space with `--off-heap-memory-size=2g`. The default value of 0 does not use any off-heap memory.| 0 |
| \\-\\-start-rest-api                  | When true, starts the REST API service. | false |
| \\-\\-redirect-output                 | When true, redirect standard output and standard error to the server log file. If specified without a value, the value is set to true. | false |
