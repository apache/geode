You can import data into a region or import an existing cluster configuration into the cluster.

-   **[import data](#topic_jw2_2ld_2l)**

    Import user data from a file to a region.

-   **[import cluster-configuration](#topic_vnv_grz_ck)**

    Import a cluster configuration.

## <a id="topic_jw2_2ld_2l" class="no-quick-link"></a>import data

Import user data from a file to a region.

**Availability:** Online. You must be connected in `gfsh` to a JMX Manager member to use this command.

**Syntax:**

``` pre
 import data --region=value --file=value --member=value [--invoke-callbacks=value]
```

| Name                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Default Value |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|
| <span class="keyword parmname">\\-\\-region</span> | *Required.* Region into which data will be imported. | |
| <span class="keyword parmname">\\-\\-file </span>  | *Required.* File from which the imported data will be read. The file must have an extension of ".gfd" and must be on the file system of the member (or accessible to that member via NFS) that is being targeted for the import. | |
| <span class="keyword parmname">&#8209;&#8209;member</span> | *Required.* Name/ID of a member that hosts the region. The data will be imported from the specified file on the host where the member is running. | |
| <span class="keyword parmname">&#8209;&#8209;invoke-callbacks</span> | Boolean value that, when true, invokes callbacks during the data import. |  false |

**Example Commands:**

``` pre
import data --region=region2 --file=/mnt5/region2_20121001.gfd --member=server1
```

## <a id="topic_vnv_grz_ck" class="no-quick-link"></a>import cluster-configuration

Imports a previously-exported cluster configuration from a zip file into a locator. This command is useful when spinning up a new cluster and when
upgrading from an older version of <%=vars.product_name%> to a new one.

- In a given cluster, only one locator needs to perform the import. 
That locator shares the imported configuration with all other connected locators in the distributed system.
- Locators share the imported configuration with data members (servers) when they start, or if they have been recently started and no other
configuration changes have been made (such as new region definitions, for example).
- Data members that were already running before the import may need to be restarted to obtain the new cluster configuration.

So, to ensure a consistent cluster configuration throughout your distributed system, perform these steps in the following order:

1. Spin up the new cluster
2. If upgrading, an already-running cluster, shut down most (or all) data members (servers) before importing a shared configuration.
3. Import the cluster configuration.
4. Start or re-start all data members (servers).

**Availability:** Online. You must be connected in `gfsh` to a locator to use this command.

**Syntax:**

``` pre
import cluster-configuration --zip-file-name=value
```

```

**Sample Output:**

``` pre
gfsh>import cluster-configuration --zip-file-name=/home/username/myClusterConfig.zip
Cluster configuration successfully imported
