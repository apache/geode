You can import data into a region or import an existing cluster configuration into the cluster.

-   **[import cluster-configuration](#topic_vnv_grz_ck)**

    Import a cluster configuration.

-   **[import data](#topic_jw2_2ld_2l)**

    Import user data from a file to a region.

## <a id="topic_vnv_grz_ck" class="no-quick-link"></a>import cluster-configuration

Imports a previously-exported cluster configuration from a zip file into a locator. This command is useful when spinning up a new cluster and when
upgrading from an older version of <%=vars.product_name%> to a new one.

- In a given cluster, only one locator needs to perform the import. 
That locator shares the imported configuration with all other connected locators in the distributed system.
- Locators share the imported configuration with data members (servers) when they start, or if they have been recently started and no other
configuration changes have been made (such as new region definitions, for example).
- Data members that were already running before the import may need to be restarted to obtain the new cluster configuration.

So, to ensure a consistent cluster configuration throughout your distributed system, perform these steps in the following order:

1. Spin up the new cluster
2. If upgrading, an already-running cluster, shut down most (or all) data members (servers) before importing a shared configuration.
3. Import the cluster configuration.
4. Start or re-start all data members (servers).

**Availability:** Online. You must be connected in `gfsh` to a locator to use this command.

**Syntax:**

``` pre
import cluster-configuration --zip-file-name=value
```

**Import Cluster-Configuration Parameters:**

| Name                                                  | Description                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="keyword parmname">\\-\\-zip-file-name</span> | *Required.* Name of the zip file containing the cluster configuration artifacts to be imported. |

**Example Commands:**

``` pre
gfsh>import cluster-configuration --zip-file-name=/home/username/myClusterConfig.zip
```

**Sample Output:**

``` pre
gfsh>import cluster-configuration --zip-file-name=/home/username/myClusterConfig.zip
Cluster configuration successfully imported
```

## <a id="topic_jw2_2ld_2l" class="no-quick-link"></a>import data

Import user data from a file or files to a region.

**Availability:** Online. You must be connected in `gfsh` to a JMX Manager member to use this command.

**Syntax:**

If the data was exported sequentially to a single file, use the serial form of the `import` command to import the data:

``` pre
import data --region=value --file=value --member=value [--invoke-callbacks=value]
```

In this scenario, data from replicated and partitioned regions is imported sequentially from a single file on the specified member.

See [export data](export.html#topic_263B70069BFC4A7185F86B3272011734) for an explanation of the difference between serial and parallel data exports.

If the data was exported from a partitioned region in parallel format, use the `--parallel` option to import the data:

``` pre
import data --parallel --region=value --member=value --dir=value [--invoke-callbacks=value]
```

In this scenario, partitioned region data is imported simultaneously on all hosting nodes from directories local to those respective nodes.

- Parallel import applies only to partitioned regions exported in parallel mode.

- The `--file` and `--dir` options are mutually exclusive; `--file` can be used only for serial import, `--dir` can be used for both serial and parallel imports.


**Import Data Parameters:**

| Name                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Default Value |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|
| <span class="keyword parmname">\\-\\-region</span> | *Required.* Region into which data will be imported. | |
| <span class="keyword parmname">&#8209;&#8209;member</span> | *Required.* Name/ID of a member that hosts the region. In a serial import, all data is imported from the specified file on the host where the member is running.  In a parallel import, data from a partitioned region partially hosted on this member is imported for each partition from files on the nodes that host those partitions. | |
| <span class="keyword parmname">\\-\\-file </span>  | File from which the imported data will be read. The file must have an extension of ".gfd" and must be on the file system of the member (or accessible to that member via NFS) that is being targeted for the import. Cannot be specified at the same time as \\-\\-dir, cannot be used with &#8209;&#8209;parallel. | |
| <span class="keyword parmname">\\-\\-dir</span>   | Directory from which the data is to be imported. Required if \\-\\-parallel is true. Cannot be specified at the same time as \\-\\-file. If a given node has no data file in the specified directory, the import operation is silently skipped for that node. | |
| <span class="keyword parmname">&#8209;&#8209;invoke&#8209;callbacks</span> | Boolean value that, when true, invokes callbacks during the data import. |  false |

**Example Commands:**

``` pre
import data --region=region2 --file=/mnt5/region2_20121001.gfd --member=server1
```
