Run queries against Geode regions.

Run the specified OQL query as a single quoted string and displays results in pages allows to move between pages. If limit is not set in the query, then a default limit of 1000 (derived from GFSH environment variable APP\_FETCH\_SIZE) will be applied. Page size is derived from GFSH environment variable APP\_COLLECTION\_LIMIT (default value=20).

**Note:**
This command should not be executed from `gfsh` if the objects being queried contain cyclic references.

**Availability:** Online. You must be connected in `gfsh` to a JMX Manager member to use this command.

**Syntax:**

``` pre
query --query=value [--step-name=value] [--interactive=value]
```
