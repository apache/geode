Before you start gfsh, confirm that you have set JAVA\_HOME and that your PATH variable includes the gfsh executable.

**Note:**
On Windows, you must have the JAVA\_HOME environment variable set properly to use start, stop and status commands for both locators and servers.

To launch the gfsh command-line interface, execute the following command at the prompt on any machine that is currently installed with Apache Geode:

**Start gfsh on Windows:**

``` pre
<product_directory>\bin\gfsh.bat 
```

where &lt;*product\_directory*&gt; corresponds to the location where you installed Apache Geode.

**Start gfsh on Unix:**

``` pre
<product_directory>/bin/gfsh
```

where &lt;*product\_directory*&gt; corresponds to the location where you installed Apache Geode. Upon execution, the `gfsh` script appends the required Apache Geode and JDK Jar libraries to your existing CLASSPATH.

If you have successfully started `gfsh`, the `gfsh` splash screen and prompt appears.

``` pre
c:\Geode\Latest>gfsh.bat
    _________________________     __

 / /__/ / ____/  _____/ / /    / /
/______/_/      /______/_/    /_/

```

You can also run some gfsh commands directly within your terminal without entering a `gfsh` prompt. For example, on Unix/Linux you could enter:

``` pre
$ gfsh start server --name=server1
```

or on Windows:

``` pre
prompt> gfsh start server --name=server1
```
