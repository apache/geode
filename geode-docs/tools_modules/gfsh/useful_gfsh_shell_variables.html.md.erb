You can use the built-in `gfsh` shell variables in scripts.

You can also use the `set variable` command to modify shell behavior or to define your own variables.

To see a list of all gfsh shell variables and their current values, use the following command:

``` pre
gfsh>echo --string=$*
```

To obtain the current value of an existing variable, use the following command syntax (the variable must be enclosed in braces):

``` pre
gfsh>echo --string=${VARIABLE}
```

For example:

``` pre
gfsh>echo --string=${SYS_CLASSPATH}
```
