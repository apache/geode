`gfsh` supports the administration, debugging, and deployment of Apache Geode processes and applications.

With `gfsh`, you can:

-   Start and stop Apache Geode processes, such as locators and cache servers
-   Start and stop gateway sender and gateway receiver processes
-   Deploy applications
-   Create and destroy regions
-   Execute functions
-   Manage disk stores
-   Import and export data
-   Monitor Apache Geode processes
-   Launch Apache Geode monitoring tools

The `gfsh` command line interface lets developers spend less time configuring cache instance XML, properties, logs, and statistics. gfsh commands generate reports; capture cluster-wide statistics; and support the export of statistics, logs, and configurations. Like Spring Roo, gfsh features command completion (so you do not have to know the syntax), context-sensitive help, scripting, and the ability to invoke any commands from within an application by using a simple API. The gfsh interface uses JMX/RMI to communicate with Apache Geode processes.

You can connect gfsh to a remote distributed system using the HTTP protocol. See [Using gfsh to Manage a Remote Cluster Over HTTP or HTTPS](../../configuring/cluster_config/gfsh_remote.html).

By default, the cluster configuration service saves the configuration of your Apache Geode cluster as you create Apache Geode objects using gfsh. You can export this configuration and import it into another Apache Geode cluster. See [Overview of the Cluster Configuration Service](../../configuring/cluster_config/gfsh_persist.html#concept_r22_hyw_bl).
