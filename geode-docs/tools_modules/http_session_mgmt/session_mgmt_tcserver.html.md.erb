This section describes how to set up and use the HTTP session management module with tc Server templates.

If you would prefer to manually change the `server.xml` and `context.xml` files rather than use tc Server templates, refer to [HTTP Session Management Module for Tomcat](session_mgmt_tomcat.html).

    This topic describes how to install the HTTP session management module with tc Server templates.

-   **[Setting Up the HTTP Module for tc Server](../../tools_modules/http_session_mgmt/tc_setting_up_the_module.html)**

    To set up the HTTP Module for tc Server, start a tc Server instance with the appropriate tc Server template based on your preferred topology.

-   **[Changing the Default Geode Configuration in the tc Server Module](../../tools_modules/http_session_mgmt/tc_changing_gf_default_cfg.html)**

    By default, the tc Server HTTP module will run Geode automatically with pre-configured settings. You can change these Geode settings.
