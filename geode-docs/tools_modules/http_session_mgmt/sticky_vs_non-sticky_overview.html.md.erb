This topic describes the differences between stick and non-sticky session in Geode

## <a id="sticky_vs_non-sticky_overview__section_B2396FB0879248DBA85ADFDBBEFA987D" class="no-quick-link"></a>Why use non-sticky sessions?

Some situations require that sessions be 'non-sticky', which means that client requests are directed to any server in a cluster of application servers rather than returning to the same server with each request for a given client. Non-sticky sessions allow for more effective load balancing as a client operating in a model using sticky session replication will return to the same server each time regardless of load. To achieve a non-sticky session model, you must configure your deployment as described for the following modules/topologies.


**Note:**
Non-sticky sessions affect performance because sessions need to be re-created every time a request hits a different server. This may not be noticeable when the session attributes are small, but may become more evident as the session attributes increase in size and/or number.

**Peer-to-Peer**

For peer-to-peer topologies, apply the following settings to enable non-sticky sessions to work correctly:

-   Java system property `gemfire.loadClassOnEveryDeserialization=true`. Set this property by editing the `bin/setenv.sh` file.
-   `prefer.deserialized.form=false`. Set this property in `conf/catalina.properties`.

**Client-server**

For client-server topologies, only the Java system property `gemfire.loadClassOnEveryDeserialization=true` must be set, in the `bin/setenv.sh file`.

**Peer-to-Peer**

For peer-to-peer topologies, apply the following settings to enable non-sticky sessions to work correctly:

-   Java system property `gemfire.loadClassOnEveryDeserialization=true`. Set this property by editing the `bin/setenv.sh` file.
-   `prefer.deserialized.form=false`. Set this property in `conf/catalina.properties`.

**Client-server**

-   The Java system property `gemfire.loadClassOnEveryDeserialization=true` must be set, in the `bin/setenv.sh file`.
-   The local client cache must be empty. Ensure that the filter property `gemfire.cache.enable_local_cache=false` is set. This effectively sets the local client cache to be a **PROXY** cache.
-   If the local client cache is a **PROXY** cache then expiration must be configured to notify the client via callback, which can be done by setting the flag `gemfire.EXPIRE_SENDS_ENTRY_AS_CALLBACK`. This allows the client cache to retrieve and expire the actual session object, resulting in more consistent behavior.

**Peer-to-Peer**

No additional configuration is required.

**Client-Server**

For client-server topologies, the local client cache must be empty. Ensure that the filter property `gemfire.cache.enable_local_cache=false` is set. This effectively sets the local client cache to be a **PROXY** cache.
