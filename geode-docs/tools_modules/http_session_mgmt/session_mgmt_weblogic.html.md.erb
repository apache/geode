You implement session caching with the HTTP Session Management Module for AppServers with a special filter, defined in the `web.xml`, which is configured to intercept and wrap all requests.

You can use this HTTP module with a variety of application servers. Wrapping each request allows the interception of `getSession()` calls to be handled by Geode instead of the native container. This approach is a generic solution, which is supported by any container that implements the Servlet 2.4 specification.

-   **[Setting Up the HTTP Module for AppServers](../../tools_modules/http_session_mgmt/weblogic_setting_up_the_module.html)**

    To use the module, you need to modify your application's `web.xml` files. Configuration is slightly different depending on the topology you are setting up.

-   **[Changing the Default Geode Configuration in the AppServers Module](../../tools_modules/http_session_mgmt/weblogic_changing_gf_default_cfg.html)**

    By default, the AppServers module will run Geode automatically with preconfigured settings. You can change these Geode settings.
