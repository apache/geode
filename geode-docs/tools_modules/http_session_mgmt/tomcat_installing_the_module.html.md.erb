This topic describes how to install the HTTP session management module for Tomcat.

1.  If you have not already installed Tomcat, download the desired version from the [Apache Website](http://tomcat.apache.org/) and install it.
2.  Following the Apache Tomcat convention, this page assumes the CATALINA_HOME environment variable is set to the root directory of the "binary" Tomcat distribution.
  For example, if Apache Tomcat is installed in `/usr/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.50` then

    ```
    CATALINA_HOME=/usr/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.50
    ```
    Define $CATALINA_HOME if it is not already defined.
  
3.  For development purposes, you may find it helpful to establish manager-level access to Tomcat. To do so, edit the file `$CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml`.
  Uncomment the following line, and replace the `<must-be-changed>` placeholder with a password of your own choosing:

    ```
      <user username="admin" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="manager-gui"/>
    ```
    This creates an admin/password credential you can use to view system information when following links from the Tomcat home page.

4.  The HTTP Session Management Module for Tomcat is included in the <%=vars.product_name%> installation package. After you install <%=vars.product_name_long%>, you will find the module in the `tools/Modules` directory of the installation with a name of the form `Apache_Geode_Modules-SERVER-VERSION-Tomcat.zip`, where SERVER-VERSION is the <%=vars.product_name_long%> version number.

5.  Set your current working directory to the `$CATALINA_HOME` directory (or wherever you installed the application server) and unzip the HTTP Session Management Module.
This adds jar files to the `lib` subdirectory and XML files to the `conf` subdirectory.

    ```
    cd $CATALINA_HOME
    unzip $GEODE_HOME/tools/Modules/Apache_Geode_Modules-SERVER-VERSION-Tomcat.zip
    ```
6.  Copy the following jar files from the <%=vars.product_name%> `lib` subdirectory to the `lib` subdirectory of your Tomcat server (`$CATALINA_HOME/lib`), adding version numbers to the filenames as needed:
    -   commons-io jar
    -   commons-lang jar
    -   commons-validator jar
    -   fastutil jar
    -   geode-common jar
    -   geode-core jar
    -   geode-logging jar
    -   geode-management jar
    -   geode-membership jar
    -   geode-serialization jar
    -   geode-tcp-server jar
    -   javax.transaction-api jar
    -   jgroups jar
    -   log4j-api jar
    -   log4j-core jar
    -   log4j-jul jar
    -   micrometer-core jar
    -   shiro-core jar

Proceed to [Setting Up the HTTP Module for Tomcat](./tomcat_setting_up_the_module.html) to complete your Tomcat configuration.
