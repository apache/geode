This topic describes how to install the HTTP session management module with tc Server templates.

1.  If you do not already have tc Server, download and install the product from the [VMware tc Server download page](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/info/slug/application_platform/vmware_vfabric_tc_server/2_9) or the [Pivotal tc Server download page](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-tcserver). These instructions require **tc Server 2.9** or later.
2.  The HTTP Session Management Module for tc Server is included in the Apache Geode installation package. After you install Apache Geode, you will find the module in the `tools/Modules` directory of the installation.

3.  Unzip the module into the Pivotal tc Server `$CATALINA_HOME/templates` directory so that it creates `geode-p2p` and `geode-cs` subdirectories within the tc Server `templates` directory.
4.  Copy these jar files from the Geode distribution `lib` directory to the `lib` directory of your tc server (`<instance>/lib`):
    -   antlr jar
    -   fastutil jar
    -   geode-core jar
    -   javax.transaction-api jar
    -   jgroups jar
    -   log4j-api jar
    -   log4j-core jar
    -   log4j-jul jar
