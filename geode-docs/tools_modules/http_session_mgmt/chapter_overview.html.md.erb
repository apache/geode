The Apache Geode HTTP Session Management modules provide fast, scalable, and reliable session replication for HTTP servers without requiring application changes.

Apache Geode offers HTTP session management modules for tc Server, Tomcat, and AppServers.

These modules are included with the Apache Geode product distribution, and installation .zip files can be found in the `tools/Modules` directory of your product installation.
