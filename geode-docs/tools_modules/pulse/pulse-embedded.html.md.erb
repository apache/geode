Use Pulse in embedded mode to monitor a Geode deployment directly from a Geode JMX Manager. By
default, the embedded Pulse application connects to the local JMX Manager that hosts the Pulse
application. Optionally, configure Pulse to connect to a Geode system of your choice.

To run Pulse in embedded mode:

1.  Configure a Geode member to run as a JMX Manager node, specifying the HTTP port on which you
will access the Pulse Web application (port 7070 by default). For example, the following command
starts a Geode locator as a JMX Manager node, using the default HTTP port 7070 for the Pulse
application:

    ``` pre
    gfsh
    gfsh> start locator --name=loc1
    ```

    **Note:**
    Geode locators become JMX Manager nodes by default. To start a non-locator member as a JMX
    Manager node, include the `--J=-Dgemfire.jmx-manager=true` option. To specify a non-default port
    number for the HTTP service that hosts the Pulse application, include the
    `--J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=port_number` option when starting the JMX Manager node.

    When the JMX Manager node boots, it starts an embedded Jetty instance and deploys the Pulse Web
    application at the specified or default HTTP port or 7070 by default.

    `gfsh` automatically connects to the manager when you start it in this way. If you already
    started a manager process earlier, use the `connect` command in `gfsh` to connect to that
    process.

2.  Access the embedded Pulse application from a Web browser. If you are connected to the Geode
cluster using gfsh, use the `start pulse` command to load the correct URL in your browser:

    ``` pre
    gfsh> start pulse
    ```

    Or, enter the URL http://*address*:*http-service-port*/pulse directly in your Web browser,
    substituting the address and HTTP port of the manager. For example, you access Pulse on the
    local locator machine from Step 1 at the URL http://localhost:7070/pulse.

3.  If you have configured authentication for the Pulse application, enter the username and password
of a valid Pulse account in the login screen. Otherwise, enter the default "admin" in both
fields. Click **Sign In** to continue.

    See [Configuring Pulse Authentication](pulse-auth.html).

4.  After you log in, Pulse displays the main cluster view for the local distributed system. See
[Using Pulse Views](pulse-views.html).

**Note:**
When running in embedded mode, the Pulse application connects only to the JMX Manager running in the
locator or member that hosts Pulse. This enables you to monitor all members of that distributed
system. You can also view (but not monitor) connected WAN clusters, and can view gateway senders and
receivers that are configured in the local cluster.
