The Redis API for <%=vars.product_name%> allows a single <%=vars.product_name%> cluster to function as a drop-in replacement for a
highly-available Redis data store with one database, letting Redis applications take advantage of
<%=vars.product_name%>’s scaling capabilities without changing their client code. Redis clients connect to a <%=vars.product_name%>
server in the same way they connect to a Redis server, using a hostname and a port number, with
optional password authentication.

## <a id="using-the-api" class="no-quick-link"></a>Using the Redis API for <%=vars.product_name%>

The <%=vars.product_name%> cluster must have at least one server that is set up to handle the incoming Redis
commands.

Use gfsh to start at least one server with a command of the form:

```pre
start server \
  --name=<serverName> \
  --locators=<locatorPort> \
  --redis-port=<redisPort> \
  --redis-bind-address=<redisBindAddress> \
  --redis-password=<redisPassword>
```

Replace `<serverName>` with the name of your server.

Replace `<locatorPort>` with your locator port.

Replace `<redisPort>` with the port that the <%=vars.product_name%> server listens on for Redis commands. The typical port used with a Redis cluster is 6379.

Replace `<redisBindAddress>` with the address of the server host.

Replace `<redisPassword>` with the password clients use to authenticate.

To confirm the server is listening, run:

``` pre
redis-cli -h <redisBindAddress> -p <redisPort> -a <redisPassword> ping
```

Replace `<redisBindAddress>`,`<redisPort>`, and `<redisPassword>` with the same values as the server.

If the server is functioning properly, you should see a response of `PONG`.

## <a id="included-commands" class="no-quick-link"></a>Included Redis Commands

The Redis API for <%=vars.product_name%> currently supports the following commands.  See [Redis commands](https://redis.io/commands/) for a complete list of and more information on Redis commands.

**Note**: These commands are supported for Redis 5.

-   **Connection**: AUTH, PING, QUIT
-   **Hashes**: HGETALL, HMSET, HSET
-   **Keys**: DEL, EXISTS, EXPIRE, EXPIREAT, KEYS, PERSIST, PEXPIRE, PEXPIREAT, PTTL, RENAME, TTL, TYPE
-   **Publish/Subscribe**: PUBLISH, PSUBSCRIBE, PUNSUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE
-   **Sets**: SADD, SMEMBERS, SREM
-   **Strings**: APPEND, GET, SET

The following Redis API for <%=vars.product_name%> commands are **unsupported**. Unsupported
commands are available to use, but have not been fully tested. There is no guarantee they will work
exactly as expected.

-   **Connection**: ECHO
-   **Hashes**: HDEL, HEXISTS, HGET, HINCRBY, HINCRBYFLOAT, HKEYS, HLEN, HMGET, HSCAN, HSETNX, HVALS
-   **Keys**: SCAN
-   **Server**: DBSIZE, FLUSHALL (no async option), FLUSHDB (no async option), SHUTDOWN, TIME
-   **Sets**: SCARD, SDIFF, SDIFFSTORE, SINTER, SINTERSTORE, SISMEMBER, SMOVE, SPOP, SRANDMEMBER,
  SSCAN, SUNION, SUNIONSTORE
-   **Strings**: BITCOUNT, BITOP, BITPOS, DECR, DECRBY, GETBIT, GETRANGE, GETSET, INCR, INCRBY, INCRBYFLOAT, MGET,
  MSET, MSETNX, PSETEX, SETBIT, SETEX, SETNX, SETRANGE, STRLEN


If you already have some Geode servers running with Redis enabled, you can execute the following
command with gfsh to enable unsupported commands:

```pre
redis --enable-unsupported-commands
```

You can also enable unsupported commands when you start the Geode server by setting the Java property `enable-redis-unsupported-commands=true`:

```pre
start server \
  --J=-Denable-redis-unsupported-commands=true \
  --name=<serverName> \
  --locators=<locatorPort> \
  --redis-port=<redisPort> \
  --redis-bind-address=<redisBindAddress> \
  --redis-password=<redisPassword>
```

Commands not listed above are **not implemented**.

## <a id="advantages-over-redis" class="no-quick-link"></a>Advantages of <%=vars.product_name%> over Redis

<%=vars.product_name%>’s primary advantage is its **scalability**. While the Redis server is single threaded, <%=vars.product_name%> supports high concurrency. Many Redis clients can execute commands on the <%=vars.product_name%> cluster simultaneously.

<%=vars.product_name%>'s architecture and management features help detect and resolve **network partitioning** problems without explicit management on the part of the Redis client.

## <a id="expiration-accuracy" class="no-quick-link"></a>Expiration Accuracy

Keys are expired in two ways, actively and passively:

-   With active expiration, expiration is evaluated whenever a key is accessed. If the key is due to expire, it is deleted. Active expiration is accurate to the millisecond.
-   With passive expiration, keys are evaluated every second. If they are due to expire, they are deleted.  Passive expiration is accurate to the second.
