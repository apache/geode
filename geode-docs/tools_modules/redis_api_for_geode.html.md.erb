The Redis API for <%=vars.product_name%> allows <%=vars.product_name%> to function as a drop-in
replacement for a highly-available Redis data store, letting Redis applications take advantage of
<%=vars.product_name%>â€™s scaling capabilities without changing their client code.

This functionality is currently under development.

For more information please review the [Redis API for Geode RFC](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Geode+Redis+API+Improvements)

If you are interested in experimenting with the Redis APIs, please follow the instructions in the
geode-redis [README](https://github.com/apache/geode/blob/develop/geode-redis) on the develop
branch.
