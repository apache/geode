<%=vars.product_name%> Micrometer provides an interface to emit user focused metrics, instrumented in code, out to a variety of different consuming Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools with ease. <%=vars.product_name%> now has Micrometer instrumentation added to a subset of information available, that can be easily emitted out of a Meter Registry.

By default, it is on and will emit metrics to any meter registry. However, certain meters will only be available with 'time-statistics' turned on.



-   **[Micrometer configuration and publishing](micrometer-configuration.html)**

    Using Micrometer may require configuration and in order to emit Micrometer metrics out to one of the APM tools supported, or a custom format/tool, a Meter Registry and accompanying publishing service will need to be utilized. 


-   **[Micrometer meters and tags](micrometer-meters.html)**

    <%=vars.product_name%> now contains a set of meters, instrumented statistics, that provide information about each individual member of the cluster. Every member within a <%=vars.product_name%> cluster will emit a set of meters of different types, timer, gauge, and counters that are specific to them. Each meter will have a set of common tags, a name/value pair, that help users identify locationally where a meter is in the cluster. There are also meter specific tags that vary based on the meter itself.
