<%=vars.product_name%> uses [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io) to provide an interface for emitting user focused metrics, instrumented in code, to a variety of different consuming Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools. <%=vars.product_name%> has Micrometer instrumentation added to a subset of information available, which can be easily emitted from a Meter Registry.

By default, Micrometer is enabeled and can emit metrics to any meter registry. However, time-based meters are available only when the `time-statistics` property is turned on.

The API is currently marked experimental.
The `MetricsSession` and `MetricsPublishingService` interfaces may change.

-   **[Micrometer configuration and publishing](micrometer-configuration.html)**

    Using Micrometer may require configuration, and in order to emit Micrometer metrics to one of the supported APM tools, or to a custom format/tool, a Meter Registry and accompanying publishing service will need to be used.

-   **[Micrometer meters and tags](micrometer-meters.html)**

    <%=vars.product_name%> contains a set of meters, instrumented statistics, that provide information about each individual member of a cluster. Every member within a <%=vars.product_name%> cluster will can emit a set of meters of different types, timer, gauge, and counters that are specific to the member.
Each meter has a set of common tags, a name/value pair, that helps users identify where a meter is located in the cluster. There are also meter specific tags that vary based on the meter itself.
