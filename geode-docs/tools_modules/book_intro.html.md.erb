<a id="deploy_run__section_tool_intro"></a>

-   **[gfsh](gfsh/chapter_overview.html)**

    `gfsh` (pronounced "jee-fish") provides a single, powerful command-line interface from which you can launch, manage, and monitor Geode processes, data, and applications.

-   **[Gemcached](gemcached/chapter_overview.html)**

    Gemcached is a Geode adapter that allows Memcached clients to communicate with a Geode server cluster, as if the servers were memcached servers. Memcached is an open-source caching solution that uses a distributed, in-memory hash map to store key-value pairs of string or object data.

-   **[HTTP Session Management Modules](http_session_mgmt/chapter_overview.html)**

    The Apache Geode HTTP Session Management modules provide fast, scalable, and reliable session replication for HTTP servers without requiring application changes.

-   **[Geode Pulse](pulse/pulse-overview.html)**

    Geode Pulse is a Web Application that provides a graphical dashboard for monitoring vital, real-time health and performance of Geode clusters, members, and regions.

-   **[Geode Redis Adapter](redis_adapter.html)**

    The Geode Redis adapter allows Geode to function as a drop-in replacement for a Redis data store, letting Redis applications take advantage of Geodeâ€™s scaling capabilities without changing their client code. Redis clients connect to a Geode server in the same way they connect to a Redis server, using an IP address and a port number.


-   **[Apache Lucene&reg; Integration](lucene_integration.html)**

    The Apache Lucene&reg; integration enables users to create Lucene indexes and execute Lucene searches on data stored in Geode.
