-   **[gfsh](gfsh/chapter_overview.html)**

    `gfsh` (pronounced "jee-fish") provides a single, powerful command-line interface from which you can launch, manage, and monitor <%=vars.product_name%> processes, data, and applications.

-   **[Gemcached](gemcached/chapter_overview.html)**

    Gemcached is a <%=vars.product_name%> adapter that allows Memcached clients to communicate with a <%=vars.product_name%> server cluster, as if the servers were memcached servers. Memcached is an open-source caching solution that uses a distributed, in-memory hash map to store key-value pairs of string or object data.

-   **[HTTP Session Management Modules](http_session_mgmt/chapter_overview.html)**

    The <%=vars.product_name_long%> HTTP Session Management modules provide fast, scalable, and reliable session replication for HTTP servers without requiring application changes.

    <%=vars.product_name%> Pulse is a Web Application that provides a graphical dashboard for monitoring vital, real-time health and performance of <%=vars.product_name%> clusters, members, and regions.

-   **[Redis API for <%=vars.product_name%>](redis_api_for_geode.html)**

    The Redis API for <%=vars.product_name%> allows <%=vars.product_name%> to function as a drop-in replacement for a Redis data store, letting Redis applications take advantage of <%=vars.product_name%>â€™s scaling capabilities without changing their client code. Redis clients connect to a <%=vars.product_name%> server in the same way they connect to a Redis server, using a hostname and a port number.

-   **[Apache Lucene&reg; Integration](lucene_integration.html)**

    The Apache Lucene&reg; integration enables users to create Lucene indexes and execute Lucene searches on data stored in <%=vars.product_name%>.

-   **[Micrometer](micrometer/micrometer-overview.html)**

    Micrometer is a simple facade for application monitoring (as SLF4J, for example, is a simple facade for logging) which allows publishing metrics from <%=vars.product_name%> to various Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools.
