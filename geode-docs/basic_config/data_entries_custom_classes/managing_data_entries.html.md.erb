Program your applications to create, modify, and manage your cached data entries.

<a id="managing_data_entries__section_AACC36127F17411F86D1E409B86C6E5C"></a>
**Note:**
If you do not have the cache's `copy-on-read` attribute set to true, do not change the objects returned from the Java entry access methods. See [Safe Entry Modification](#managing_data_entries__section_A0E0F889AC344EFA8DF304FD64418809).

## <a id="managing_data_entry_keys" class="no-quick-link"></a>Keys

<%=vars.product_name%> calls `hashCode()` on the key
to map an entry within the region.
The `hashCode()` return value must be the same for
a given key on every server that hosts the region.

An `equals()` call return value on a given key also must be
the same on every server that hosts the region.

A key may be a primitive type or a custom class.
For custom classes, see [Classes Used as Keys](using_custom_classes.html#using_custom_classes__section_CE776B94EDCB4D269A71C3C9CFEDD5FD).

Do not use an enumerated type (`enum`) for a key.
The `enum` `hashCode()` may not be overridden,
and its hash code is based upon an address.
Therefore, the return value for a `hashCode()` call can be different
on each server, violating the restriction that it must return
the same value on every server that hosts the region. 

## <a id="managing_data_entries__section_B095A4073EFB4A3C91AF7C03632EEBFB" class="no-quick-link"></a>Create and Update Entries

To create or update an entry in the cache, use `Region.put`. For example:

``` pre
String name = ... 
String value = ...  
this.currRegion.put(name,value); 
```

**Note:**
You can also use the `gfsh put` command to add entries to a region, and the `get` command to retrieve entries from a region. See [get](../../tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/get.html) and [put](../../tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/put.html) for more information.

If you want only to create the entry (with a null value and with method failure if the entry already exists), use `Region.create` instead.

## <a id="getAll_method" class="no-quick-link"></a>The getAll Operation

The batch operation `Region.getAll`
takes a collection of keys and returns a `Map` of key-value pairs for
the provided keys. If a given key does not exist in the region, then that key's value in the returned map will be null.

## <a id="putAll_method" class="no-quick-link"></a>The putAll Operation

The batch operation `Region.putAll`
takes a `Map` of key-value pairs, puts them into the cache,
and then distributes them to all other members.

The design of a client application within a client-server design pattern
faces the possibility that a partial operation can occur.
Some, all, or none of the specified key-value pairs may be written
with `putAll`.
If either `ServerOperationException` or `ServerConnectivityException` is
thrown,
it can indicate an incomplete operation.

``` pre
// Retry if the exception may be due to a transient cause.
for (int retry = 0; retry < 3; retry++) {
  throwable = null;
  try {
    region.putAll(map);
  } catch (ServerOperationException e) {
    throwable = e.getCause();
    if (!(e.getCause() instanceof TimeoutException ||
          e.getCause() instanceof LowMemoryException)) {
      // Not a transient exception. Do not retry.
      break;
    }
  } catch (ServerConnectivityException e) {
    throwable = e;
  }
}

if (throwable != null) {
  // Take appropriate action,
  // such as logging the exception and rethrowing it.
  System.out.println("putAll failed due to " + throwable);
  throw new Exception(throwable);
}
``` 

Either a `ServerConnectivityException` or a `ServerOperationException`
with a cause of
`TimeoutException` or `LowMemoryException` can indicate a transient error.
A limited quantity of retries of `putAll` may result in a completed
operation.
A repeated timeout may imply that the `read-timeout` value is not
long enough to complete the bulk operation;
use the `org.apache.geode.cache.client.PoolFactory.setReadTimeout`
method to set the `read-timeout` value.

Client applications that cannot tolerate partial completion of a `putAll`
operation may embed the operation into a transaction.
See [Transactions](../../developing/transactions/chapter_overview.html)
for details.

The processing of a map with many entries and/or extra-large data values
may affect system performance and cause cache update timeouts,
especially if the region uses overflow or persistence to disk.
The processing may also cause a `LowMemoryException` to be thrown.

## <a id="removeAll_method" class="no-quick-link"></a>The removeAll Operation


The `removeAll` method takes a collection of keys and removes all of the entries for the specified keys from this region. This call performs the equivalent of calling`destroy(Object)` on this region once for each key in the specified collection. If an entry does not exist, then that key is skipped. An `EntryNotFoundException` is not thrown. This operation will be distributed to other caches if the region's scope is not set to `Scope.LOCAL`.

The processing of a map with many entries and/or extra-large data values
may affect system performance and cause cache update timeouts,
especially if the region uses overflow or persistence to disk.
The processing may also cause a `LowMemoryException` to be thrown.

## <a id="managing_data_entries__section_A0E0F889AC344EFA8DF304FD64418809" class="no-quick-link"></a>Safe Entry Modification

When you get an entry value from the cache, by default, the retrieval methods return a direct reference to the cached object. This provides the value as quickly as possible, but also opens the cache to direct, in-place changes.

**Note:**
Do not directly modify cached values. Modifying a value in place bypasses the <%=vars.product_name%> distribution framework, including cache writers and listeners, expiration activities, and transaction management, and can produce undesired results.

Always change your entries using copies of the retrieved objectsâ€”never directly modify the returned objects. You can do this in one of two ways:

1.  Change the entry retrieval behavior for your cache by setting the cache attribute, `copy-on-read`, to true (the default is false).

    ``` pre
    <cache copy-on-read="true">
     ...
    </cache>
    ```

    When `copy-on-read` is true, the entry access methods return copies of the entries. This protects you from inadvertently modifying in-place, but negatively impacts performance and memory consumption when copying is not needed.

    These entry access methods return an entry reference if `copy-on-read` is false and a copy of the entry if `copy-on-read` is true:

    `Region.get`
    result of `Region.put`
    `EntryEvent.getNewValue`
    `Region.values`
    `Region.Entry.getValue`
    `EntryEvent.getOldValue`
    `Query.select`

2.  Create a copy of the returned object and work with that. For objects that are cloneable or serializable, you can copy the entry value to a new object using `org.apache.geode.CopyHelper.copy`. Example:

    ``` pre
    Object o = (StringBuffer)region.get("stringBuf");
    StringBuffer s = (StringBuffer) CopyHelper.copy(o);
    s.append("Changes to value, added using put.");
    region.put("stringBuf", s);
    ```

## <a id="managing_data_entries__section_78F6731642944DE594316B86ECB4E70F" class="no-quick-link"></a>Retrieving Region Entries from Proxy Members

The `Region.values` method call applies to the local region instance only. If you call the `values` method from a client region using the PROXY shortcut, the method call will not be redirected to the server region. To obtain a collection of all values in the Region from a client, you should use interest registration on ALL\_KEYS, or use a query.

If you use the `Region.get` method from a proxy member, the method call will redirect to the region on the server if it cannot find the key locally.

## Using gfsh to get and put

You can use the gfsh `get` and `put` commands to manage data. See [get](../../tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/get.html) and [put](../../tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/put.html).

For example:

``` pre
get --key=('id':'133abg124') --region=region1

// Retrieving when key type is a wrapper(primitive)/String
get --key=('133abg124') --region=/region1/region12 --value-class=data.ProfileDetails

get --key=('100L') --region=/region1/region12 --value-class=data.ProfileDetails 
--key-class=java.lang.Long
```

``` pre
put --key=('id':'133abg125') --value=('firstname':'James','lastname':'Gosling') 
--region=/region1 --key-class=data.ProfileKey --value-class=data.ProfileDetails

put --key=('133abg124') --value=('Hello World!!') --region=/region2

put --key=('100F') --value=('2146547689879658564')  --region=/region1/region12 
--key-class=java.lang.Float --value-class=java.lang.Long
```
