A new region or distributed system may need to be loaded with the data of an existing system. There are two approaches to accomplish this task. The approach used depends upon the organization of both the new and the existing distributed system.

If both the number and the type of members is the same in both the new and the existing distributed system, then the simplest option is to use backup and restore on the persistent disk store contents. Make a full online backup of the persistent data in the disk store of the existing distributed system. Copy the files that comprise the backup to the new distributed system location. A restore instills the data into the new distributed system. See [Creating Backups for System Recovery and Operational Management](../../managing/disk_storage/backup_restore_disk_store.html) for details on how to make a backup and use the backup to restore a disk store.

Take a different approach when the number or the type of members is *not* the same in both the new and the existing distributed system. This approach uses export and import of region data. Export the region data of the existing distributed system to create a snapshot. Copy the snapshot to the new distributed system location. Import the snapshot into the new distributed system. See appropriate sections within [Cache and Region Snapshots](../../managing/cache_snapshots/chapter_overview.html) for details on making and using a snapshot.
