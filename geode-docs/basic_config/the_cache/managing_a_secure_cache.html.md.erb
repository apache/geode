A secured system does both authentication at connection time
and authorization prior to cache operations.
Client apps and cluster members (servers and locators) require
configuration and setup when the `SecurityManager` is enabled.

See the section on  [Security](../../managing/security/chapter_overview.html)
for details.
For authentication, see 
[Implementing Authentication](../../managing/security/implementing_authentication.html).
