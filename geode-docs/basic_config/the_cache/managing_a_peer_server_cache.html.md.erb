You start your peer or server cache using a combination of XML declarations and API calls. Close the cache when you are done.

<a id="creating_and_closing_a_peer_cache__section_1633A80F0DB04794BB6C3A7F05EED97E"></a>
Geode peers are members of a Geode distributed system that do not act as clients to another Geode distributed system. Geode servers are peers that also listen for and process client requests.

1.  Create your cache:
    1.  Start up a cluster and the cluster configuration service:
        1.  Start a locator with `--enable-cluster-configuration` set to true. (It is set true by default.)

            ``` pre
            gfsh>start locator --name=locator1
            ```

        2.  Start up member processes that use the cluster configuration service (enabled by default):

            ``` pre
            gfsh>start server --name=server1 --server-port=40404
            ```

        3.  Create regions:

            ``` pre
            gfsh>create region --name=customerRegion --type=REPLICATE

            gfsh>create region --name=ordersRegion --type=PARTITION
            ```

    2.  Or if you are not using the cluster configuration service, directly configure cache.xml in each member of your cluster. In your `cache.xml`, use the `cache` DOCTYPE and configure your cache inside a `<cache>` element. Example:

        ``` pre
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <cache
            xmlns="http://geode.apache.org/schema/cache"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://geode.apache.org/schema/cache http://geode.apache.org/schema/cache/cache-1.0.xsd"
            version="1.0”>
            // NOTE: Use this <cache-server> element only for server processes 
            <cache-server port="40404"/>
            <region name="customerRegion" refid="REPLICATE" />
            <region name="ordersRegion" refid="PARTITION" />
        </cache>
        ```

    3.  To programmatically create the `Cache` instance:
        -   In your Java application, use the `CacheFactory` create method:

            ``` pre
            Cache cache = new CacheFactory().create();
            ```
        -   If you are running a server using the Geode `cacheserver` process, it automatically creates the cache and connection at startup and closes both when it exits.

        The system creates the distributed system connection and initializes the cache according to your `gemfire.properties` and `cache.xml` specifications.

2.  Close your cache when you are done using the inherited `close` method of the `Cache` instance:

    ``` pre
    cache.close();
    ```
