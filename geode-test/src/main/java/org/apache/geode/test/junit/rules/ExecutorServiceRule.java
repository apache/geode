/**
 * Provides a reusable mechanism for executing tasks asynchronously in tests. This {@code Rule}
 * creates an {@code ExecutorService} which is terminated after the scope of the {@code Rule}. This
 * {@code Rule} can be used in tests for hangs, deadlocks, and infinite loops.
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, the {@code ExecutorService} is single-threaded. You can specify the thread count by
 * using {@link Builder#threadCount(int)} or {@link #ExecutorServiceRule(int)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example with default configuration (single-threaded and does not assert that tasks are done):
 *
 * <pre>
 * private CountDownLatch hangLatch = new CountDownLatch(1);
 *
 * {@literal @}Rule
 * public AsynchronousRule asynchronousRule = new AsynchronousRule();
 *
 * {@literal @}Test
 * public void doTest() throws Exception {
 *   Future<Void> result = asynchronousRule.runAsync(() -> {
 *     try {
 *       hangLatch.await();
 *     } catch (InterruptedException e) {
 *       throw new RuntimeException(e);
 *     }
 *   });
 *
 *   assertThatThrownBy(() -> result.get(1, MILLISECONDS)).isInstanceOf(TimeoutException.class);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code Rule} can be configured to await termination by specifying
 * {@link Builder#awaitTermination(long, TimeUnit)}. If all tasks have not terminated by the
 * specified timeout, then {@code TimeoutException} will be thrown. This has the potential to
 * obscure any {@code Throwable}s thrown by the test itself.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example with awaitTermination enabled. Awaits up to timeout for all submitted tasks to terminate.
 * This causes the {@code Rule} to invoke awaitTermination during its tear down:
 *
 * <pre>
 * private CountDownLatch hangLatch = new CountDownLatch(1);
 *
 * {@literal @}Rule
 * public ExecutorServiceRule asynchronousRule = ExecutorServiceRule.builder().threadCount(10).awaitTermination(10, MILLISECONDS).build();
 *
 * {@literal @}Test
 * public void doTest() throws Exception {
 *   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
 *     asynchronousRule.runAsync(() -> {
 *       try {
 *         hangLatch.await();
 *       } catch (InterruptedException e) {
 *         // do nothing
 *       }
 *     });
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
