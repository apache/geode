  <BODY>
  The <code>com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client</code> package provides APIs used
  for client connectivity and caching.
<p>
Most clients will only need to create a 
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client.ClientCache}
using a
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client.ClientCacheFactory}.
<p>
A client configures the servers it will connect to by creating one or more
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client.Pool pools}.
For most use cases one pool per client is all you need and the easiest
way to get a single pool is to use
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client.ClientCacheFactory}.
If you do need more than one pool use a
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client.PoolFactory pool factory} obtained from the
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client.PoolManager pool manager} before you
create the cache using 
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client.ClientCacheFactory}.
<p>
An alternative to these APIs is to use the <code>pool</code> XML element
as described in the <code>cache6_5.dtd</code>.
<p>
If you create more than one pool then for regions that will use a pool you
need to configure the pool name on the regions.
This can be done by setting the
pool name on the region using the
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client.ClientRegionFactory#setPoolName API}
or using the <code>pool-name</code> attribute on the <code>region-attributes</code>
as described in the <code>cache6_5.dtd</code>.

<a name="declarative"><h2>Client Declarative Caching</h2>

<p>A "caching XML file" declares regions, entries, and attributes.  When
a <code>ClientCache</code> is created its contents can be initialized
according to a caching XML file.
The top level element must be a client-cache element.
</p>

<p>The Document Type Definition for a declarative cache XML file can
be found in <code>"doc-files/cache6_5.dtd"</code>.
For examples of declarative cache XML files see <A
href="doc-files/example-client-cache.xml">example1</A>.
