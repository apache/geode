<P>Contains the implementation of the external admin APIs from
<a href="{@docRoot}/com/gemstone/gemfire/admin/package-summary.html#package_description">com.gemstone.gemfire.admin</a>.</P>

<H2>Monitoring the "health" of GemFire</H2>

<P>The health monitoring implementation comes in two pieces.  On the
client (administrator) side there is a {@link
com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.internal.GemFireHealthImpl} object that is
responsible for configuring a {@link
com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.HealthMonitorImpl} that runs
in the member VMs.  The communication between the administration
process and the member process is accomplised via a {@link
com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.admin.GemFireVM GemFireVM} from the
"internal admin" API.  The <code>HealthMonitorImpl</code> is a thread
that periodically consults a {@link
com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.internal.GemFireHealthEvaluator} that uses
a {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.internal.GemFireHealthConfigImpl}
to determine the health of a GemFire component.  Most of the health
criteria are based on {@linkplain com.gemstone.gemfire.Statistics
statistics} that are maintained by GemFire.  When the
<code>HealthMonitorImpl</code> determines that the health of a GemFire
component has changed, it alerts the administrator process via a
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.admin.HealthListener}.</P>


<P>The below diagram explains how the classes that monitor the health
of GemFire are implemented.</P>
