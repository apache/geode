This is the XML DTD for the GemFire distributed system administrative
configuration XML file.  All configuration files must include a
DOCTYPE of the following form:

  <!DOCTYPE distributed-system PUBLIC
    "-//GemStone Systems, Inc.//GemFire Distributed System 5.0//EN"
    "http://www.gemstone.com/dtd/ds5_0.dtd">

The contents of a distributed system configuration XML file correspond
to APIs found in the

                      com.gemstone.gemfire.admin

package.  A distributed system configuration XML file is used by tools
such as the GemFire JMX Agent to initialize information a distributed system.

<!--

The following conventions apply to all GemFire distributed system
configuration XML file elements unless indicated otherwise.

- In elements that contain PCDATA, leading and trailing whitespace in
  the data may be ignored.

- In elements whose value is an "enumerated type", the value is case
  sensitive.
