/*
 * Configuration for running (dunit) tests in parallel in Docker containers.
 * The container used must hava JAVA_HOME set in it's environment and must
 * have 'java' defined on the path. For example, the relevant Dockerfile
 * content could be:
 * 
 *   ENV JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_u101
 *   ENV PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
 *
 * In addition, the container must have docker installed.
 *
 * The plugin can be activated with the Gradle property 'parallelDunit'.
 * Additional properties that can be set are:
 *
 *  dunitDockerImage   - The docker image used for running parallel dunits. The
 *                       default image is 'openjdk:8'. The image is required to
 *                       have 'JAVA_HOME' set as an environment variable.
 *  dunitParallelForks - The number of parallel containers that will be
 *                       launched. The default is 8.
 *  dunitDockerUser    - The user used within the docker container to run tests.
 *                       The default is 'root'.
