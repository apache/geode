 * Implementers of interface <code>FixedPartitionResolver</code> helps to

 * <p>
 * GemFire uses the partition name returned by 
 * {@link FixedPartitionResolver#getPartitionName(EntryEvent, CacheableHashSetPtr)}
 * to determine on which member the data is being managed. Say, for example, you want to
 * partition all Trades according to quarters. You can implement
 * FixedPartitionResolver to get the name of the quarter based on the date given
 * as part of {@link EntryEvent}.
