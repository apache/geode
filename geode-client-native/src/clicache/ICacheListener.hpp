      /// of <c>ICacheListener</c> methods.  If event A occurs before event B,
      /// there is no guarantee that their corresponding <c>ICacheListener</c>
      /// method invocations will occur in the same order. Any exceptions thrown by
      /// the listener are caught by GemFire and logged. If the exception is due to
      /// listener invocation on the same thread where a region operation has been
      /// performed, then a <c>CacheListenerException</c> is thrown back to
      /// the application. If the exception is for a notification received from
      /// server then that is logged and the notification thread moves on to
      /// receiving other notifications.
      /// <para>
      /// A cache listener is defined in the <see cref="RegionAttributes" />.
      /// </para>
      ///
      /// There are two cases in which listeners are invoked. The first is when a
      /// region modification operation (e.g. put, create, destroy, invalidate)
      /// is performed. For this case it is important to ensure that minimal work is
      /// done in the listener before returning control back to Gemfire since the
      /// operation will block till the listener has not completed. For example,
      /// a listener implementation may choose to hand off the event to a thread pool
      /// that then processes the event on its thread rather than the listener thread.
      /// The second is when notifications are received from java server as a result
      /// of region register interest calls (<c>Region.RegisterKeys</c> etc),
      /// or invalidate notifications when notify-by-subscription is false on the
      /// server. In this case the methods of <c>ICacheListener</c> are invoked
      /// asynchronously (i.e. does not block the thread that receives notification
      /// messages). Additionally for the latter case of notifications from server,
      /// listener is always invoked whether or not local operation is successful
      /// e.g. if a destroy notification is received and key does not exist in the
      /// region, the listener will still be invoked. This is different from the
      /// first case where listeners are invoked only when the region update
      /// operation succeeds.
