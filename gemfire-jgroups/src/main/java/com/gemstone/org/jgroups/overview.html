JGroups is a toolkit for reliable group communication. Processes
can join a group, send messages to all members or single members, and
receive messages from members in the group. The system keeps track of
the members in every group, and notifies group members when a new
member joins, or an existing member leaves or crashes. A group is
identified by its name. Groups do not have to be created explicitly;
when a process joins a non-existing group, that group will be created
automatically. Member processes of a group can be located on the same
host, within the same LAN, or across a WAN. A member can be part of
multiple groups.
