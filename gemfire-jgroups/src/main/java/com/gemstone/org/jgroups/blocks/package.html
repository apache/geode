	<BODY>
		Provides building blocks that are layered on top of channels. 
		Most of them do not even need a channel, all they need is a class 
		that implements interface Transport (channels do). 
		This enables them to work on any type of group transport that obeys this interface. 
		Building blocks can be used instead of channels whenever a higher-level interface 
		is required. Whereas channels are simple socket-like constructs, building blocks 
		may offer a far more sophisticated interface. In some cases, building blocks offer 
		access to the underlying channel, so that - if the building block at hand does not 
		offer a certain functionality - the channel can be accessed directly.
