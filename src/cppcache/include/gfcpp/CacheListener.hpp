/**
 * @class CacheListener CacheListener.hpp
 * An application plug-in that can be installed on a region.
 * Listeners are change notifications that are invoked
 * AFTER the change has occured for region update operations on a client.
 * Listeners also receive notifications when entries in a region are modified.
 * Multiple events can cause concurrent invocation
 * of <code>CacheListener</code> methods.  If event A occurs before event B,
 * there is no guarantee that their corresponding <code>CacheListener</code>
 * method invocations will occur in the same order. Any exceptions thrown by
 * the listener are caught by GemFire and logged. If the exception is due to
 * listener invocation on the same thread where a region operation has been
 * performed, then a <code>CacheListenerException</code> is thrown back to
 * the application. If the exception is for a notification received from
 * server then that is logged and the notification thread moves on to
 * receiving other notifications.
 *
 * There are two cases in which listeners are invoked. The first is when a
 * region modification operation (e.g. put, create, destroy, invalidate)
 * is performed. For this case it is important to ensure that minimal work is
 * done in the listener before returning control back to Gemfire since the
 * operation will block till the listener has not completed. For example,
 * a listener implementation may choose to hand off the event to a thread pool
 * that then processes the event on its thread rather than the listener thread.
 * The second is when notifications are received from java server as a result
 * of region register interest calls (<code>Region::registerKeys</code> etc),
 * or invalidate notifications when notify-by-subscription is false on the
 * server. In this case the methods of <code>CacheListener</code> are invoked
 * asynchronously (i.e. does not block the thread that receives notification
 * messages). Additionally for the latter case of notifications from server,
 * listener is always invoked whether or not local operation is successful
 * e.g. if a destroy notification is received and key does not exist in the
 * region, the listener will still be invoked. This is different from the
 * first case where listeners are invoked only when the region update
 * operation succeeds.
