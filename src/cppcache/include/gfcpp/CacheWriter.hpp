/**
 * @class CacheWriter CacheWriter.hpp
 * An application plug-in that can be installed on the region.
 * Defines methods that are called BEFORE entry modification.
 * A distributed region will typically have a single cache writer.
 * If the application is designed such that all or most updates to
 * a region occurs on a node, it is desirable to have the cache writer
 * for the region to be installed at that node.
 *
 * Cache writer invocations are initiated by the node where the entry or
 * region modification occurs. If there is a local cache writer on the node
 * where the change occurs, that is invoked. If there is no local cache writer
 * , the system knows which of the nodes that have the region defined have a
 * cache writer defined.
 *
 * Note that cache writer callbacks are synchronous callbacks and have the
 * ability
 * to veto the cache update. Since cache writer invocations require
 * communications
 * over the network, (especially if they are not colocated on the nodes where
 * the
 * change occurs) the use of cache writers presents a performance penalty.
 *
 * A user-defined object defined in the {@link RegionAttributes} that is
 * called synchronously before a region or entry in the cache is modified.
 *
 * The typical use for a <code>CacheWriter</code> is to update a database.
 * Application writers should implement these methods to execute
 * application-specific behavior before the cache is modified.
 *
 * <p>Before the region is updated via a put, create, or destroy operation,
 * GemFire will call a <code>CacheWriter</code> that is installed anywhere in
 * any
 * participating cache for that region, preferring a local
 * <code>CacheWriter</code>
 * if there is one. Usually there will be only one <code>CacheWriter</code> in
 * the distributed system. If there are multiple <code>CacheWriter</code>s
 * available in the distributed system, the GemFire
 * implementation always prefers one that is stored locally, or else picks one
 * arbitrarily. In any case, only one <code>CacheWriter</code> will be invoked.
 *
 * <p>The <code>CacheWriter</code> is capable of aborting the update to the
 * cache by throwing
 * a <code>CacheWriterException</code>. This exception or any runtime exception
 * thrown by the <code>CacheWriter</code> will abort the operation, and the
 * exception will be propagated to the initiator of the operation, regardless
 * of whether the initiator is in the same process as the
 * <code>CacheWriter</code>.
