* PdxInstance provides run time access to the fields of a PDX without
* deserializing the PDX. Preventing deserialization saves time
* and memory.
* The PdxInstance implementation
* is a light weight wrapper that simply refers to the raw bytes of the PDX
* that are kept in the cache.
* Applications can choose to access PdxInstances instead of C++ objects by
* configuring the Cache to prefer PDX instances during deserialization.
* This can be done in <code>cache.xml</code> by setting the attribute
* <code>read-serialized</code>
* to true on the <code>pdx</code> element. Or it can be done programmatically
* using
* {@link CacheFactory#setPdxReadSerialized(boolean) setPdxReadSerialized}
* method. Once this preference is configured, then any time deserialization of a
* PDX is done it will deserialize into a PdxInstance.
* PdxInstance are immutable. If you want to change one call {@link
* #createWriter}.
