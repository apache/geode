/**
 * @class CacheLoader CacheLoader.hpp
 * An application plug-in that can be installed on a region. Loaders
 * facilitate loading of data into the cache. When an application does a
 * lookup for a key in a region and it does not exist, the system checks to
 * see if any loaders are available for the region in the system and
 * invokes them to get the value for the key into the cache.
 * Allows data to be loaded from a 3rd party data source and placed
 * into the region
 * When {@link Region::get} is called for a region
 * entry that has a <code>NULLPTR</code> value, the
 * {@link CacheLoader::load} method of the
 * region's cache loader is invoked.  The <code>load</code> method
 * creates the value for the desired key by performing an operation such
 * as a database query.
 *
 * @see AttributesFactory::setCacheLoader
