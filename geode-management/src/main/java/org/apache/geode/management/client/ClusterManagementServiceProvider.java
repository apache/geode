/**
 * Top-level entry point for client interaction with the {@link ClusterManagementService}. A user
 * can create an instance of the {@code ClusterManagementService} (CMS for short) in several ways,
 * each providing various level of control or expediency.
 * <p/>
 * Calling {@code getServiceFactory(context)} will return an explicit instance of {@link
 * ClusterManagementServiceFactory}. Methods on this factory can then be called to create or
 * retrieve instances of a CMS. New {@link ClusterManagementServiceProvider}s can be written if
 * specific customization or parameterization is required.
 * <p/>
 * A note about contexts. A context is simply a unique string which identifies a specific instance
 * of CMS that will be returned. Contexts map to the different uses of a CMS. Currently, the
 * following contexts are provided:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * {@code JAVA_CLIENT_CONTEXT} ("java-client") - would be used to retrieve a CMS instance on a pure
 * Java client - i.e. an app that is not running in the context of a Geode client or server. This
 * context is available when using the <i>geode-management</i> module.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code GEODE_CONTEXT} ("geode") - would be used to retrieve a CMS instance
 * from a JVM where either a {@code Cache} or {@code ClientCache} exists. This context is available
 * when using the <i>geode-core</i> module.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * If the URL of the Cluster Management Service is known, the {@code getService(url)} method can be
 * called. This implicitly uses the {@code JAVA_CLIENT_CONTEXT}. For further control the CMS can be
 * configured with a {@link ClientHttpRequestFactory} by calling {@code
 * getService(requestFactory)}.
 * <p/>
 * Finally, the simplest way to create a CMS instance is simply to call {@code getService()}. This
 * method will attempt to infer the context and use an appropriate service provider to create a CMS
 * instance.
