## Example requirements

All examples:

*  Need to be testable. Use unit tests, integration tests or whatever is applicable. Tests will run through the project's CI.
*  Should be `Gradle` projects or part of existing ones. There may be exceptions here, but the community should have a consensus to accept.
*  Have to follow code format & style from Apache Geode <sup>[1]</sup> guidelines.
*  Should contain a `README.md` file with step-by-step instruction on how to set up and run the example. *Diagrams give you extra credit.*
*  Donations need to be licensed through ASL 2.0 and contributors need to file an ICLA<sup>[3]</sup>.
