title:  System Failure and Recovery
---

This section describes alerts for and appropriate responses to various kinds of system failures. It also helps you plan a strategy for data recovery.

If a system member withdraws from the distributed system involuntarily because the member, host, or network fails, the other members automatically adapt to the loss and continue to operate. The distributed system does not experience any disturbance such as timeouts.

## Planning for Data Recovery

In planning a strategy for data recovery, consider these factors:

-   Whether the region is configured for data redundancy—partitioned regions only.
-   The region’s role-loss policy configuration, which controls how the region behaves after a crash or system failure—distributed regions only.
-   Whether the region is configured for persistence to disk.
-   The extent of the failure, whether multiple members or a network outage is involved.
-   Your application’s specific needs, such as the difficulty of replacing the data and the risk of running with inconsistent data for your application.
-   When an alert is generated due to network partition or slow response, indicating that certain processes may, or will, fail.

The rest of this section provides recovery instructions for various kinds system failures.

## Network Partitioning, Slow Response, and Member Removal Alerts

When a network partition detection or slow responses occur, these alerts are generated:

-   Network Partitioning is Detected
-   Member is Taking Too Long to Respond
-   No Locators Can Be Found
-   Warning Notifications Before Removal
-   Member is Forced Out

For information on configuring system members to help avoid a network partition configuration condition in the presence of a network failure or when members lose the ability to communicate to each other, refer to [Understanding and Recovering from Network Outages](recovering_from_network_outages.html#rec_network_crash).

## Member Taking Too Long to Respond

Alert:

``` pre
15 sec have elapsed while waiting for replies: <ReplyProcessor21 6 waiting for 1 replies 
from [ent(27130):60333/36743]> on ent(27134):60330/45855 whose current membership 
list is: [[ent(27134):60330/45855, ent(27130):60333/36743]]
```

Description:

Member ent(27130):60333/36743 is in danger of being forced out of the distributed system because of a suspect-verification failure. This alert is issued at the warning level, after the ack-wait-threshold is reached.

Response:

The operator should examine the process to see if it is healthy. The process ID of the slow responder is 27130 on the machine named ent. The ports of the slow responder are 60333/36743. Look for the string, Starting distribution manager ent:60333/36743, and examine the process owning the log file containing this string.

Alert:

``` pre
30 sec have elapsed while waiting for replies: <ReplyProcessor21 6 waiting for 1 replies

for 1 replies from [ent(4592):33593/35174]> on ent(4592):33593/35174 whose current 
membership list is: [[ent(4598):33610/37013, ent(4611):33599/60008, 
ent(4592):33593/35174, ent(4600):33612/33183, ent(4593):33601/53393, ent(4605):33605/41831]]
```

Description:

This alert is issued by partitioned regions and regions with global scope at the warning level, when the lock grantor has not responded to a lock request within the ack-wait-threshold and the ack-severe-alert-threshold.

Response:

None.

Alert:

``` pre
30 sec have elapsed while waiting for replies: <DLockRequestProcessor 23604 waiting 
for 1 replies from [ent(4592):33593/35174]> on ent(4598):33610/37013 whose current

## No Locators Can Be Found

**Note:**
It is likely that all processes using the locators will exit with the same message.

Alert:

``` pre
Membership service failure: Channel closed: com.gemstone.gemfire.ForcedDisconnectException: 
There are no processes eligible to be group membership coordinator 
(last coordinator left view)
```

Description:

Network partition detection is enabled (enable-network-partition-detection is set to true), and there are locator problems.

Response:

The operator should examine the locator processes and logs, and restart the locators.

Alert:

``` pre
Membership service failure: Channel closed: com.gemstone.gemfire.ForcedDisconnectException: 
There are no processes eligible to be group membership coordinator 
(all eligible coordinators are suspect)
```

Description:

Network partition detection is enabled (enable-network-partition-detection is set to true), and there are locator problems.

Response:

The operator should examine the locator processes and logs, and restart the locators.

Alert:

``` pre
Membership service failure: Channel closed: com.gemstone.gemfire.ForcedDisconnectException: 
Unable to contact any locators and network partition detection is enabled
```

Description:

Network partition detection is enabled (enable-network-partition-detection is set to true), and there are locator problems.

Response:

The operator should examine the locator processes and logs, and restart the locators.

Alert:

``` pre
Membership service failure: Channel closed: com.gemstone.gemfire.ForcedDisconnectException: 
Disconnected as a slow-receiver
```

Description:

The member was not able to process messages fast enough and was forcibly disconnected by another process.

Response:

The operator should examine and restart the disconnected process.

## Warning Notifications Before Removal

Alert:

``` pre
Membership: requesting removal of ent(10344):21344/24922 Disconnected as a slow-receiver
```

Description:

This alert is generated only if the slow-receiver functionality is being used.

Response:

The operator should examine the locator processes and logs.

Alert:

``` pre
Network partition detection is enabled and both membership coordinator and lead member 
are on the same machine
```

Description:

This alert is issued if both the membership coordinator and the lead member are on the same machine.

Response:

The operator can turn this off by setting the system property gemfire.disable-same-machine-warnings to true. However, it is best to run locator processes, which act as membership coordinators when network partition detection is enabled, on separate machines from cache processes.

## Member Is Forced Out

Alert:

``` pre
Membership service failure: Channel closed: com.gemstone.gemfire.ForcedDisconnectException: 
This member has been forced out of the Distributed System. Please consult GemFire logs to 
find the reason.
```

Description:

The process discovered that it was not in the distributed system and cannot determine why it was removed. The membership coordinator removed the member after it failed to respond to an internal are you alive message.

Response:

The operator should examine the locator processes and logs.
