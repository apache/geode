                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>Apache Geode (incubating) is a data management platform that provides real-time, consistent access to data-intensive applications throughout widely distributed cloud architectures.</p>

                <p>By pooling memory, CPU, network resources, and (optionally) local disk across multiple processes to manage application objects and behavior, it uses dynamic replication and data partitioning techniques to implement high availability, improved performance, scalability, and fault tolerance. In addition to being a distributed data container, Apache Geode is an in-memory data management system that provides reliable asynchronous event notifications and guaranteed message delivery.</p>

                <p>Apache Geode is a mature, robust technology originally developed by GemStone Systems in Beaverton, Oregon.
Commercially available as GemFireâ„¢, the technology was first widely deployed in the financial sector as the transactional, low-latency data engine used
in Wall Street trading platforms.
Today Apache Geode is used by over 600 enterprise customers for high-scale business applications that must meet low latency and 24x7 availability requirements.</p>

                <p>This project is undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
