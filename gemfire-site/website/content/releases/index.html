				Releases of Geode are made available to the general public at no charge, under the <a href="http://apache.org/licenses/">Apache License</a>, in both binary and source distributions.

					Project releases are approved by vote of the Apache Geode Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) and Apache Incubator (PMC). Support for a release is provided by project volunteers on the project <a href="http://geode.incubator.apache.org/community/#mailing-lists">mailing lists</a>. Bugs found in a release may be discussed on the list and reported through the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE">issue tracker</a>. The user mailing list and issue tracker are the only support options hosted by the Apache Geode project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note: When downloading from a mirror, please be sure to verify that checksums and signatures are correct. To do so, use the checksum and signature files from the main Apache site at <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/geode/">https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/geode/</a>. Find here the KEYS file, which contains all OpenPGP keys we use to sign releases here: <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/geode/KEYS">https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/geode/KEYS</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/geode/KEYS">KEYS</a> as well as the <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/geode/geode-1/v1.0.0/">asc signature</a> file for the particular distribution. Then verify the signatures using:
				</p>
				<p>
       				% pgpk -a KEYS
					</br></br>
        			% pgpv ${filename}.tar.gz.asc
        			</br></br>
    				or
    				</br></br>
        			% pgp -ka KEYS
        			</br></br>
        			% pgp ${filename}.tar.gz.asc
        			</br></br>
    				or
    				</br></br>
        			% gpg --import KEYS
        			</br></br>
        			% gpg --verify ${filename}.tar.gz.asc
        			</br></br>
        		</p>
    			<p>
					Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files. A Unix program called md5 or md5sum is included in many Unix distributions. It is also available as part of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html">GNU Textutils</a>. Windows users can get binary md5 programs from <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/">here</a>, or <a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/">here</a>.
