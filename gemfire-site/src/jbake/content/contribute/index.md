# Contribute

Development of the code base for Geode began in 2002 as the commercial product GemFire. The open source version of Geode was released in April, 2015. 

The [primary contributors](https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/GeodeProposal) include long standing members of the GemFire engineering team, implementers and customers with long standing relationships.

The Apache Incubator Proposal for Geode can be found [here](https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/GeodeProposal)

Ideas for extending Geode code can be found in the wiki [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/How+to+Contribute).

There are many ways to [support an open source software project beyond contributing code](http://opensource.com/business/14/12/8-ways-contribute-open-source-without-writing-code) to the master branch. For Geode, here are some ways you can contribute today:

* **Post Issues:** Build and run the [Geode source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-geode), and [post issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE) on the Apache Geode (incubating) JIRA.

* **Documentation:** [Add to the documentation](https://github.com/project-geode/docs), and [submit new articles](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/) to the wiki for best practices and [user training](https://github.com/project-geode/training).

* **Website:** Improve the website itself. It runs out of the [asf-site branch](https://github.com/apache/incubator-geode/tree/asf-site), but its source is GitHub flavored markdown that lives in our ASF repo.

* **Art & Design:** Offer to help with art & design of Geode. Pivotal has donated an initial look and feel, but the logos, branding, and identity are property of the Project.

* **Discuss:** Start and weigh in on discussions. Currently we are hosting threaded discussions on the [Geode mailing lists](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-geode-dev/). Itâ€™s also common to find [Stack Overflow questions covering GemFire and Geode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/geode+or+gemfire). 

* **Present:** Give a presentation or create a video about the project.  We are already beginning to add presentations and [training materials](https://github.com/project-geode/training) as they are created.  Feel free to download and use.  If you are hosting an event, put it into the community calendar on the site. If you create a new presentation, please check it into the project GitHub.
