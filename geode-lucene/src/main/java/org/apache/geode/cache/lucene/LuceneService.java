/**
 *
 * The LuceneService provides the capability to create Lucene indexes and execute lucene queries on
 * data stored in Geode regions. The Lucene indexes are automatically maintained by Geode whenever
 * entries are updated in the associated regions.
 *
 * <p>
 * To obtain an instance of LuceneService, use
 * {@link LuceneServiceProvider#get(GemFireCache cache)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Lucene indexes can be created using gfsh, xml, or the java API. Below is an example of creating a
 * Lucene index with the java API. The Lucene index should be created on each member that has the
 * region that is being indexed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   &#64;code
 *       luceneService.createIndexFactory()
 *        .addField("name")
 *        .addField("zipcode")
 *        .addField("email", new KeywordAnalyzer())
 *        .create(indexName, regionName);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * You can also specify what {@link Analyzer} to use for each field. In the example above, email is
 * being tokenized with the KeywordAnalyzer so it is treated as a single word. The default analyzer
 * if none is specified is the {@link StandardAnalyzer}.
 * </p>
 * 
 *
 * Indexes should be created on all peers that host the region being indexed. Clients do not need to
 * define the index, they can directly execute queries using this service.
 *
 * <p>
 * Queries on this service can return either the region keys, values, or both that match a Lucene
 * query expression. To execute a query, start with the {@link #createLuceneQueryFactory()} method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   &#64;code
 *   LuceneQuery query = luceneService.createLuceneQueryFactory().setLimit(200).create(indexName,
 *       regionName, "name:John AND zipcode:97006", defaultField);
 *   Collection results = query.findValues();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The Lucene index data is colocated with the region that is indexed. This means that the index
 * data will be partitioned, copied, or persisted using the same configuration options you provide
 * for the region that is indexed. Queries will automatically be distributed in parallel to cover
 * all partitions of a partitioned region.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Indexes are maintained asynchronously, so changes to regions may not be immediately reflected in
 * the index. This means that queries executed using this service may return stale results. Use the
 * {@link #waitUntilFlushed(String, String, long, TimeUnit)} method if you need to wait for your
 * changes to be indexed before executing a query, however this method should be used sparingly
 * because it is an expensive operation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Currently, only partitioned regions are supported. Creating an index on a region with
 * {@link DataPolicy#REPLICATE} will fail.
 * </p>
