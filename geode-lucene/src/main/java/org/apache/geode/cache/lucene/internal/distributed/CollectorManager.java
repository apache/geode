 * used for aggregating results of other collectors of same type. Typically search result
 * aggregation is completed in two phases. First at a member level for merging results from local
 * buckets. And then at search coordinator level for merging results from members. Use of same
 * collector in both phases is expected to produce deterministic merge result irrespective of the
 * way buckets are distributed.
