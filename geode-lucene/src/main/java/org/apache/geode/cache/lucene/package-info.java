/**
 * This package provides an integration with Apache Lucene that allows Geode regions to be indexed
 * in a distributed Lucene index and queries using Lucene queries.
 * <p>
 * All indexing and query operations are performed through the
 * {@link org.apache.geode.cache.lucene.LuceneService} class. See
 * {@link org.apache.geode.cache.lucene.LuceneService} for an example of how to add a lucene index
 * to a geode region.
 * <p>
 *
 * The Lucene indexes created using this API are stored in geode and colocated with the indexed
 * region, which means they have the same availability guarantees as the underlying region. The
 * indexes are maintained asynchronously, so changes to the region may not be immediately visible in
 * the lucene index.
