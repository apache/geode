/**
 * This is a rule to start up a locator in your current VM. It's useful for your Integration Tests.
 *
 * You can create this rule with and without a Property. If the rule is created with a property, the
 * locator will started automatically for you. If not, you can start the locator by using one of the
 * startLocator function. Either way, the rule will handle shutting down the locator properly for
 * you.
 *
 * If you need a rule to start a server/locator in different VMs for Distributed tests, You should
