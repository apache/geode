/**
 * Abstract cancellation proxy for cancelling an operation, esp. a thread.
 * 
 * Creators of services or threads should implement a subclass of CancelCriterion, and implement the
 * two methods - cancelInProgress, and generateCancelledException(e).
 * 
 * Code inside the service can check to see if the service is cancelled by calling
 * {@link #checkCancelInProgress(Throwable)}. Generally the pattern is to check before performing an
 * operation, check if the service is canceled before propgrating an exception futher up the stack,
 * and check for cancelation inside a long loop. Eg.
 * 
 * <code>
 * while(true) {
 *   c.checkCancelInProgress(null);
 *   try {
 *      dispatchEvents();
 *   } catch(IOException e) {
 *     c.checkCancelInProgress(e);
 *     throw e;
 *   }
 * }
 * </code>
