/**
 * {@code Instantiator} allows classes that implement {@link DataSerializable} to be registered with
 * the data serialization framework. Knowledge of {@code DataSerializable} classes allows the
 * framework to optimize how instances of those classes are data serialized.
 *
 * <P>
 *
 * Ordinarily, when a {@code DataSerializable} object is written using
 * {@link DataSerializer#writeObject(Object, java.io.DataOutput)}, a special marker class id is
 * written to the stream followed by the class name of the {@code DataSerializable} object. After
 * the marker class id is read by {@link DataSerializer#readObject} it performs the following
 * operations,
 *
 * <OL>
 *
 * <LI>The class name is read</LI>
 *
 * <LI>The class is loaded using {@link Class#forName(java.lang.String)}</LI>
 *
 * <LI>An instance of the class is created using reflection</LI>
 *
 * <LI>{@link DataSerializable#fromData} is invoked on the newly-created object</LI>
 *
 * </OL>
 *
 * However, if a {@code DataSerializable} class is {@linkplain #register(Instantiator) registered}
 * with the data serialization framework and assigned a unique class id, an important optimization
 * can be performed that avoid the expense of using reflection to instantiate the
 * {@code DataSerializable} class. When the object is written using
 * {@link DataSerializer#writeObject(Object, java.io.DataOutput)}, the object's registered class id
 * is written to the stream. Consequently, when the data is read from the stream, the
 * {@link #newInstance} method of the appropriate {@code Instantiator} instance is invoked to create
 * an "empty" instance of the {@code DataSerializable} instead of using reflection to create the new
 * instance.
 *
 * <P>
 *
 * Commonly, a {@code DataSerializable} class will register itself with the {@code Instantiator} in
 * a static initializer as shown in the below example code.
 *
 * <PRE>
public class User implements DataSerializable {
  private String name;
  private int userId;

  static {
    Instantiator.register(new Instantiator(User.class, 45) {
        public DataSerializable newInstance() {
          return new User();
        }
      });
  }

  public User(String name, int userId) {
    this.name = name;
    this.userId = userId;
  }

  &#47;**
   * Creates an "empty" User whose contents are filled in by
   * invoking its toData() method
   *&#47;
  private User() {

  }

  public void toData(DataOutput out) throws IOException {
    out.writeUTF(this.name);
    out.writeInt(this.userId);
  }

  public void fromData(DataInput in)
    throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    this.name = in.readUTF();
    this.userId = in.readInt();
  }
}
 * </PRE>
 *
 * {@code Instantiator}s may be distributed to other members of the distributed system when they are
 * registered. Consider the following scenario in which VM1 and VM2 are members of the same
 * distributed system. Both VMs define the sameRegion and VM2's region replicates the contents of
 * VM1's using replication. VM1 puts an instance of the above {@code User} class into the region.
 * The act of instantiating {@code User} will load the {@code User} class and invoke its static
 * initializer, thus registering the {@code Instantiator} with the data serialization framework.
 * Because the region is a replicate, the {@code User} will be data serialized and sent to VM2.
 * However, when VM2 attempts to data deserialize the {@code User}, its {@code Instantiator} will
 * not necessarily be registered because {@code User}'s static initializer may not have been invoked
 * yet. As a result, an exception would be logged while deserializing the {@code User} and the
 * replicate would not appear to have the new value. So, in order to ensure that the
 * {@code Instantiator} is registered in VM2, the data serialization framework distributes a message
 * to each member when an {@code Instantiator} is {@linkplain #register(Instantiator) registered}.
 * <p>
 * Note that the framework does not require that an {@code Instantiator} be
 * {@link java.io.Serializable}, but it does require that it provide a
 * {@linkplain #Instantiator(Class, int) two-argument constructor}.
