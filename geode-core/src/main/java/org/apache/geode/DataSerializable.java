/**
 * An interface for objects whose state can be written/read as primitive types and strings ("data").
 * That is, instead of serializing itself to an {@link java.io.ObjectOutputStream}, a
 * <code>DataSerializable</code> can serialize itself to a {@link DataOutput}. By implementing this
 * interface, objects can be serialized faster and in a more compact format than standard Java
 * serialization. The {@link DataSerializer} class contains a number of static methods that may be
 * helpful to implementations of <code>DataSerializable</code>.
 *
 * <P>
 *
 * When possible, GemFire respects the <code>DataSerializable</code> contract to provide optimal
 * object serialization. For instance, if a <code>DataSerializable</code> object is
 * {@linkplain org.apache.geode.cache.Region#put(Object, Object) placed} into a distributed cache
 * region, its <code>toData</code> method will be used to serialize it when it is sent to another
 * member of the distributed system.
 *
 * <P>
 *
 * To avoid the overhead of Java reflection, <code>DataSerializable</code> classes may register an
 * {@link Instantiator} to be used during deserialization. Alternatively, classes that implement
 * <code>DataSerializable</code> can provide a zero-argument constructor that will be invoked when
 * they are read with {@link DataSerializer#readObject}.
 *
 * <P>
 *
 * Some classes (especially third-party classes that you may not have the source code to) cannot be
 * modified to implement <code>DataSerializable</code>. These classes can be data serialized by an
 * instance of {@link DataSerializer}.
 *
 * <P>
 *
 * <code>DataSerializable</code> offers improved performance over standard Java serialization, but
 * does not offer all of the features of standard Java serialization. In particular, data
 * serialization does not attempt to maintain referential integrity among the objects it is writing
 * or reading. As a result, data serialization should not be used with complex object graphs.
 * Attempting to data serialize graphs that contain object cycles will result in infinite recursion
 * and a {@link StackOverflowError}. Attempting to deserialize an object graph that contains
 * multiple reference paths to the same object will result in multiple copies of the objects that
 * are referred to through multiple paths.
 *
 * <P>
