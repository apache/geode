/**
 * ShadowPartitionedRegion for replicated region uses this PartitionResolver. In shadowPR for RR, we
 * are storing eventID as key into the buckets calculated from "key" of the original events. It
 * means unlike to normal scenario, in this case bucket id (in which EventIDs are added as key) is
 * different from the bucket id calculated using EventID's hashcode. To not to break the contract of
 * key and its bucket id, we are providing an internal resolver which will return a correct bucketId
 * when EventID will be used as the key in RR with PArallelGatewaySender
 * 
 * We are assuming here, before calling getRoutingObejct in this Resolver, key of EntryOperation
 * i.e. EventID as already been processed by ParallelGatewaySenderImpl#setModifiedEvent where we are
 * calculating bucketId from original event's key and storing it in EventID.
