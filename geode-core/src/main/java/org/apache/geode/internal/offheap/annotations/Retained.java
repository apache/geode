/**
 * This annotation is used to mark a reference count increment to an off-heap value:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When used on a method declaration it indicates that the method called retain on the return
 * value if it is an off-heap reference.</li>
 * <li>When used on a constructor declaration this annotation indicates that field members may be
 * off-heap references and retain will be invoked on the field methods. This also indicates that the
 * class will have a release method.</li>
 * <li>When used on a parameter declaration it indicates that the method will call retain on the
 * parameter if it is an off-heap reference.</li>
 * <li>When used on a local variable it indicates that the variable will reference an off-heap value
 * that has been retained. Typically, the method will also be responsible for releasing the value
 * (unless it is the return value).</li>
 * <li>This annotation is also used to mark fields (instance variables) that will have a retain
 * count during the lifetime of the containing object. Typically, these fields will have their
 * reference counts decremented in release method.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * One or more OffHeapIdentifiers may be supplied if the developer wishes to link this annotation
 * with other off-heap annotations.
