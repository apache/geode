/**
 * This class is intended to hold a single 'observer' which will receive callbacks from the
 * Distributed/Local Region when events like clear take place. There can be only one such observer
 * at a time. If no observer is needed, this member variable should point to an object with
 * 'do-nothing' methods, such as CacheObserverAdapter.
 * 
 * Code which wishes to observe events during Region clear should do so using the following
 * technique:
 * 
 * class MyCacheObserver extends CacheObserverAdapter { // ... override methods of interest ... }
 * 
 * CacheObserver old = CacheObserverHolder.setInstance(new MyCacheObserver());
 * org.apache.geode.internal.cache.LocalRegion.ISSUE_CALLBACKS_TO_CACHE_OBSERVER=true;
 * 
 * try { Call region methods here } finally { // reset to the original CacheObserver.
 * CacheObserverHolder.setInstance(old); }
 * 
 * The Region code will call methods on this static member using the following technique:
 * 
 * CacheObserver observer = CacheObserverHolder.getInstance(); try {
 * observer.startMethod(arguments); doSomething(); } finally { observer.stopMethod(arguments); }
 *
