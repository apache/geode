/**
 * RVV exceptions are part of a RegionVersionVector. They are held by RegionVersionHolders.
 * <p>
 * 
 * An RVV exception represents a missing range of versions from a member. This is represented as a
 * pair of version numbers: the last version we've received from the member and the next version
 * we've received from the member. The span of versions between (but not including) these two
 * numbers are the versions that are missing.
 * <p>
 * 
 * RVVException also tracks the scattering of versions we've received that fall within the range of
 * the exception. As these missing versions are received the RVVException coalesces the range. If
 * isFilled() returns true after adding a missing version to the RVVException, the hole has been
 * filled and the RVVException is no longer needed.
 * <p>
 * 
 * New exceptions are common to see as operations arrive from parallel threads operating on the same
 * region. These exceptions are soon mended and disappear.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Old exceptions indicate that we missed something that we are unlikely to receive without asking
 * for it.
 * <p>
 * 
 * RVVException currently depends on external synchronization. Typically the RegionVersionHolder
 * that holds the exception is locked while accessing its RVVExceptions. This is what is done in
 * RegionVersionVector.
