/**
 * This annotation is used to mark a reference count decrement to an off-heap value:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Use this annotation on a parameter declaration to indicate that the method will decrement
 * (call release) on the off-heap reference.</li>
 * <li>When used on method declarations this annotation indicates that the method will call release
 * on one or more field members of the class instance.</li>
 * <li>When used on a local variable this annotation indicates that the variable will be released
 * within the containing method (typically in a finally block).</li>
 * <li>Can also be used on fields to augment the @Retained annotation.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * One or more OffHeapIdentifiers may be supplied if the developer wishes to link this annotation
 * with other off-heap annotations.
