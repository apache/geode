<p>This package provides authentication and authorization for a client.  There is a default
"no-op" implementation that is overridden by the Protobuf form of client/server
   communication.</p>
<p>This can also be overridden by _you_ in order to use a different mechanism
on the server by setting the property geode.protocol-authentication-mode to the name
   of your implementation.  This is the string returned by your class's
   implementationID method.</p>

<p>The Authenticator.authenticate() method
   is first given the i/o streams connected to the client so that it
can interact with the client to get credentials.  A simple mechanism might expect a
username and password on the input stream.</p>

<p>Once the client is authenticated the Authenticator will be asked for an authorizer each time
a message is received.  The authorizer will be asked if the authenticated principal
is authorized for permissions associated with the request sent by the client.</p>

<p><i>Note: the legacy "GemFire" client/server authorization mechanism is hardcoded
to get credentials using a non-documented interchange and is not affected by this package.
It interacts directly with the SecurityManager, as does the default mechanism used in
Protobuf communications.</i></p>
