/**
 * This class provides a simple implementation of {@link SecurityManager} for authentication and
 * authorization solely based on the username and password provided.
 *
 * It is meant for demo purpose, not for production.
 *
 * Authentiation: All users whose password matches the username are authenticated. e.g.
 * username/password = test/test, user/user, admin/admin
 *
 * Authorization: users whose username is a substring (case insensitive) of the permission required
 * are authorized. e.g. username = data: is authorized for all data operations: data; data:manage
 * data:read data:write username = dataWrite: is authorized for data writes on all regions:
 * data:write data:write:regionA username = cluster: authorized for all cluster operations username
 * = cluserRead: authorzed for all cluster read operations
