/**
 * <p>
 * The <code>UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter</code> is a wrapper for
 * {@link org.apache.geode.management.membership.MembershipListener} and
 * {@link ClientMembershipListener}, providing a facade that makes both appear as a single
 * <code>MembershipListener</code> . This includes adapting <code>ClientMembershipListener</code>
 * events to appear as events for the <code>MembershipListener</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter</code> implements <code>MembershipListener</code>,
 * exposing the callback in that interface as methods to be overridden by implementing classes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An internal implementation of <code>ClientMembershipListener</code> is registered when this class
 * is instantiated. This implementation creates a
 * {@link org.apache.geode.management.membership.MembershipEvent} and calls the corresponding
 * <code>MembershipListener</code> public methods on
 * <code>UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter</code>.The <code>ClientMembershipEvent</code>s are
 * wrapped to appear as <code>MembershipEvent</code>s. In this way, both types of membership events
 * appear as <code>MembershipEvent</code>s.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Any CacheServer using the <code>UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter</code> will receive
 * notifications of peer membership changes and client membership changes through a single listener.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Any cache client using the <code>UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter</code> would receive
 * notifications of cache server connection changes. If that cache client also creates a connection
 * to the GemFire {@link org.apache.geode.distributed.DistributedSystem}, then it will also register
 * the adapter for membership events. But it wont be an automatic process. User needs to register
 * the UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter with ManagementService to receive membership events. How
 * to register UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter with ManagementService is explained below.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Subclasses of <code>UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter</code> may be registered as a
 * <code>MembershipListener</code> using
 * {@link org.apache.geode.management.ManagementService#addMembershipListener} .It is best, however,
 * to register the listener using {@link #registerMembershipListener} since this allows the adapter
 * to prevent duplicate events for members that are both a peer member and a client.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Simply constructing the <code>UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter</code> results in the underlying
 * <code>ClientMembershipListener</code> also being registered.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following code illustrates how a CacheServer application would use
 * <code>UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter</code>. The code in this example assumes that the class
 * MyMembershipListenerImpl extends <code>UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter</code>:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * public class MyMembershipListenerImpl extends UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter {
 *   public void memberCrashed(MembershipEvent event) {
 *     // customer code
 *   }
 *   public void memberLeft(MembershipEvent event) {
 *     // customer code
 *   }
 *   public void memberJoined(MembershipEvent event) {
 *     // customer code
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 *  Cache cache = //Get hold of GemFire Cache instance
 *  ManagementService service = ManagementService.getExistingManagementService(cache);
 *    
 *  MyMembershipListenerImpl myListener = new MyMembershipListenerImpl();
 *  myListener.registerMembershipListener(service);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The callback on MyMembershipListenerImpl would then be invoked for all
 * <code>MembershipEvent</code>s and <code>ClientMembershipEvent</code>s. The latter will appear to
 * be <code>MembershipEvent</code>s.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Similarly, the following code illustrates how a client application would use
 * <code>UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter</code>, where MyMembershipListenerImpl is a
 * subclass.Simply by constructing this subclass of <code>UniversalMembershipListenerAdapter</code>
 * it is registering itself as a <code>ClientMembershipListener</code>:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * new MyMembershipListenerImpl();
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * A client that also connects to the <code>DistributedSystem</code> could register with
 * the<code>ManagementService</code> as shown above.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is recommended that subclasses register with the <code>ManagementService</code> using
 * {@link #registerMembershipListener}, as this will prevent duplicate events for members that are
 * both clients and peer members.If duplicate events are acceptable, you may register subclasses
 * using {@link org.apache.geode.management.ManagementService#addMembershipListener
 * ManagementService#addMembershipListener}.
 * </p>
