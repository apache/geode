/**
 * Marker interface for an object that GemFire creates and returns from
 * {@link PdxReader#readUnreadFields() readUnreadFields}. If you call readUnreadFields then you must
 * also call {@link PdxWriter#writeUnreadFields(PdxUnreadFields) writeUnreadFields} when that object
 * is reserialized. If you do not call {@link PdxWriter#writeUnreadFields(PdxUnreadFields)
 * writeUnreadFields} but you did call {@link PdxReader#readUnreadFields() readUnreadFields} the
 * unread fields will not be written.
 * <p>
 * Unread fields are those that are not explicitly read with a {@link PdxReader} readXXX method.
 * This should only happen when a domain class has changed by adding or removing one or more fields.
 * Unread fields will be preserved automatically (unless you turn this feature off using
 * {@link org.apache.geode.cache.CacheFactory#setPdxIgnoreUnreadFields(boolean)
 * setPdxIgnoreUnreadFields} or
 * {@link org.apache.geode.cache.client.ClientCacheFactory#setPdxIgnoreUnreadFields(boolean) client
 * setPdxIgnoreUnreadFields}) but to reduce the performance and memory overhead of automatic
 * preservation it is recommended that use {@link PdxReader#readUnreadFields() readUnreadFields} if
 * possible.
