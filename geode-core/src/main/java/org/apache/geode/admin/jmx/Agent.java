/**
 * A server component that provides administration-related information about a GemFire distributed
 * system via the Java Management Extension JMX API. When a JMX <code>Agent</code> is created, it
 * registers an MBean that represents {@link #getObjectName itself}. Click
 * <A href="doc-files/mbeans-descriptions.html">here</A> for a description of the attributes,
 * operations, and notifications of this and other GemFire JMX MBeans.
 *
 * <P>
 *
 * The GemFire JMX Agent currently supports three JMX "adapters" through which clients can access
 * the GemFire management beans: an "HTTP adapter" that allows a web browser client to view and
 * modify management beans via HTTP or HTTPS, an "RMI adapter" that allows Java programs to access
 * management beans using Remote Method Invocation, and an "SNMP adapter" that allows SNMP to access
 * management beans. Information about configuring these adapters can be found in
 * {@link AgentConfig}.
 *
 * <P>
 *
 * In most distributed caching architectures, JMX administration agents are run in their own
 * processes. A stand-alone JMX agent is managed using the <code>agent</code> command line utility:
 *
 * <PRE>
 * $ agent start
 * </PRE>
 *
 * This class allows a GemFire application VM to host a JMX management agent. Architectures with
 * "co-located" JMX agents reduce the number of overall proceses required. However, hosting a JMX
 * management agent in the same VM as a GemFire application is not generally recommended because it
 * adds extra burden to an application VM and in the event that the application VM exits the
 * administration information will no longer be available.
 *
 * @see AgentConfig
 * @see AgentFactory
 *
 * @since GemFire 4.0
 * @deprecated as of 7.0 use the <code><a href=
 *             "{@docRoot}/org/apache/geode/management/package-summary.html">management</a></code>
 *             package instead
