/**
 * Instances of this interface maintain the values of various application-defined statistics. The
 * statistics themselves are described by an instance of {@link StatisticsType}.
 *
 * <P>
 * To get an instance of this interface use an instance of {@link StatisticsFactory}.
 * <P>
 *
 * For improved performance, each statistic may be referred to by its {@link #nameToDescriptor
 * descriptor}.
 * <P>
 * For optimal performance, each statistic may be referred to by its {@link #nameToId id} in the
 * statistics object. Note that ids can not be mapped back to their name and methods that take ids
 * are unsafe. It is important to call the correct type of method for the given id. For example if
 * your stat is a long then incLong must be called instead of incInt.
 * <p>
 * Note that as of the 5.1 release the <code>incInt</code>, <code>incLong</code>, and
 * <code>incDouble</code> methods no longer return the new value of the statistic. They now return
 * <code>void</code>. This incompatible change was made to allow for a more efficient concurrent
 * increment implementation.
