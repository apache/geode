/**
 * Represents a distribution locator server that provides discovery information to members and
 * clients of a GemFire distributed system. In most GemFire distributed cache architectures,
 * distribution locators are run in their own process. A stand-alone locator process is managed
 * using gfsh command line utility.
 * 
 * The stand-alone locator configuration provides high-availability of membership information.
 * 
 * <P>
 * 
 * This class allows a GemFire application VM to host a distribution locator. Such a configuration
 * minimizes the number of processes that are required to run GemFire. However, hosting distribution
 * locators is not generally recommended because if the application VM exits it would not be
 * possible for new applications to connect to the distributed system until it is restarted.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Locators persist membership information in a locatorXXXview.dat file. This file is used to
 * recover information about the cluster when a locator starts if there are no other currently
 * running locators. It allows the restarted locator to rejoin the cluster.
 * 
 * <P>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> In this release of the product locators log membership views and cache server status
 * in a locatorXXXviews.log file, where XXX is the locator's port. This is a rolling log capped in
 * size at 5mb. In order to log cache server status the locator will enable server-location, so the
 * locator must be started with a DistributedSystem or be started so that it creates a
 * DistributedSystem. This means that it is not possible in this release to use APIs to start a
 * locator and <i>then</i> start a DistributedSystem.
 * <P>
 *
