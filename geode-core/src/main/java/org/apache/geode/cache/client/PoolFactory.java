/**
 * This interface provides for the configuration and creation of instances of {@link Pool}.
 * <p>
 * Every pool needs to have at least one {@link #addLocator locator} or {@link #addServer server}
 * added to it. Locators should be added unless direct connections to cache servers are desired.
 * <p>
 * The setter methods are used to specify non-default values for the other pool properties.
 * <p>
 * Once it is configured {@link #create} will produce an instance.
 * <p>
 * The factory can be restored to its default configuration by calling {@link #reset}.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this interface can be created by calling {@link PoolManager#createFactory}.
 * <p>
 * If a subscription is going to be made using a pool then subscriptions
 * {@link #setSubscriptionEnabled must be enabled} on the pool. Subscriptions are made using these
 * APIs:
