/**
 * An index that is built over the data stored in a GemFire {@link Region}.
 * <p>
 * For a description of the types of indexes that GemFire currently supports, see
 * {@linkplain IndexType}.
 * <p>
 * An index is specified using a name, indexedExpression, fromClause, and optionally a
 * projectionAttributes.
 * <p>
 * The name uniquely identifies the index to for the statistics services in GemFire.
 * <p>
 * The indexedExpression is the lookup value for the index. The way that an indexedExpression is
 * specified and used varies depending on the type of index. For more information, see
 * {@linkplain IndexType}.
 * <p>
 * The fromClause specifies the collection(s) of objects that the index ranges over, and must
 * contain one and only one region path.
 * <p>
 * The optional projectAttributes specifies a tranformation that is done on the values and is used
 * for pre-computing a corresponding projection as defined in a query.
