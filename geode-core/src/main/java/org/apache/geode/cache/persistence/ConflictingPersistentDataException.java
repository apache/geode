/**
 * Thrown when a member with persistence is recovering, and it discovers that the data it has on
 * disk was never part of the same distributed system as the members that are currently online.
 * 
 * This exception can occur when two members both have persistent files for the same region, but
 * they were online at different times, so the contents of their persistent files are completely
 * different. In that case, gemfire throws this exception rather than discarding one of the sets of
 * persistent files.
