/**
 * A load probe is installed in a cache server to measure the load on the cache server for balancing
 * load between multiple cache servers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The getLoad method will be called once per poll interval see
 * {@link CacheServer#setLoadPollInterval(long)} The {@link ServerLoad} object returned by the
 * getLoad method will be sent to the locator every time the load for this server changes. To
 * conserve bandwidth, it's a good idea to round the load calculations so that the load will not be
 * sent too frequently.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link ServerLoad} object contains two floating point numbers indicating the load on the
 * server due to client to server connections and due to subscription connections. When routing a
 * connection, the locator will choose the server that has the lowest load.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is generally a good idea to pick a load function where 0 connections corresponds to 0 load.
 * The default gemfire load probes return a fraction between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no load, and
 * 1 indicates the server is completely loaded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because cache servers can be stopped, reconfigured, and restarted, the open and close methods on
 * this callback can be called several times. If the same callback object is installed on multiple
 * cache servers, open and close will be called once for each cache server.
 * </p>
