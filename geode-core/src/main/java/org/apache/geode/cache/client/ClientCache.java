/**
 * A ClientCache instance controls the life cycle of the local singleton cache in a client.
 * <p>
 * A ClientCache is created using {@link ClientCacheFactory#create}. See {@link ClientCacheFactory}
 * for common usage patterns for creating the client cache instance.
 * <p>
 * ClientCache provides access to functionality when a member connects as a client to GemFire
 * servers. It provides the following services:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Access to existing regions (see {@link #getRegion} and {@link #rootRegions}).
 * <li>Creation of regions (see {@link #createClientRegionFactory(ClientRegionShortcut)} and
 * {@link #createClientRegionFactory(String)}).
 * <li>Access the query service (see {@link #getQueryService} and
 * {@link #getLocalQueryService}).</li>
 * <li>Access the GemFire logger (see {@link #getLogger}).</li>
 * <li>Access the GemFire distributed system (see {@link #getDistributedSystem}).</li>
 * <li>Access the GemFire resource manager (see {@link #getResourceManager}).</li>
 * <li>Manages local disk stores for this cache instance (see {@link #createDiskStoreFactory}).</li>
 * <li>Creation of authenticated cache views that support multiple users (see
 * {@link #createAuthenticatedView}).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A ClientCache connects to a server using a {@link Pool}. This pool can be configured in the
 * ClientCacheFactory (by default GemFire tries to create a pool which tries to connect to a server
 * on the localhost on port 40404). This default pool is used by {@link Region}s (created using
 * {@link ClientRegionFactory}) to talk to regions on the server.
 * <p>
 * More pools can be created using {@link PoolManager} or by declaring them in cache.xml.
