  /**
   * 
   * Asif : Evaluates as a filter taking advantage of indexes if appropriate. This function has a
   * meaningful implementation only in CompiledComparison & CompiledUndefined . It is unsupported in
   * other classes. The additional parameters which it takes are a boolean which is used to indicate
   * whether the index result set needs to be expanded to the top level or not. The second is a
   * CompiledValue representing the operands which are only iter evaluatable. In case of a
   * GroupJunction, the CompiledValue passed will be null except if a GroupJunction has only one
   * filter evaluatable condition & rest are iter operands. In such cases , the iter operands will
   * be evaluated while expanding/cutting down the index resultset. In case of
   * CompositeGroupJunction, the iter operand may be passed as not null while evaluating the last
   * Composite condition iff the number of GroupJunctions present is zero. If there exists one
   * GroupJunction, then since the GroupJunction gets expanded to the CompositeGroupJunction level ,
   * the iter operand can be evaluated along with the iter operands of the GroupJunction, else the
   * iter operand can get evaluated during cartesian/expansion of GroupJunctions. Ofcourse, the iter
   * operands will get pushed to CompositeGroupJunction level, in the first place , only if a single
   * CompositeGroupJunction gets created. *
   * 
   * @param context ExecutionContext object
   * @param iterationLimit SelectResults object representing the intermediate ResultSet. It is
   *        mostly passed as null or the value is ignored except when evaluating a filter
   *        evaluatable composite condition ( equi join condition across the regions) for an AND
   *        junction inside a CompositeGroupJunction
   * @param completeExpansionNeeded A boolean which indicates whether a GroupJunction or a
   *        CompositeGroupJunction needs to be expanded to the query from clause iterator level (
   *        i.e to the top level)
   * @param iterOperands CompiledComparison or CompiledJunction representing the operands which are
   *        iter evaluatable
   * @param indpndntItrs An Array of RuntimeIterators . This is passed as null in case of a where
   *        clause containing single condition. It is used to identify the order of iterators to be
   *        present in the Select Results ( StructBag or ResultBag) so that their is consistency in
   *        the Object Type of the SelectResults which enables union or intersection to occur
   *        correctly. It also helps in identifying the mapping of SelectResults fields and their
   *        RuntimeIterators during the cartesian/expansion of results in the AllGroupJunction. The
   *        Independent For GroupJunction , it is normally a single Iterator representing the
   *        independent iterator for the Group. But when a GroupJunction is part of a
   *        CompositeGroupJunction & there exists only a single GroupJunction in it , the Array will
   *        contain more than one independent iterators for the group, with the independent
   *        iterators being that of CompositeGroupJunction. If the completeExpansion flag is true ,
   *        then this will be null as in that case , the position of iterators in the Results is
   *        decided by the actual order of iterators in the Query from clause .
