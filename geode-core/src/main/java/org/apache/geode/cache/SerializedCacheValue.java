 * If this value originated from a region stored off heap then this object can only be used as long
 * as notification method that obtained it has not returned. For example if your implementation of
 * {@link CacheListener#afterUpdate(EntryEvent)} obtains one by calling
 * {@link EntryEvent#getSerializedOldValue()} then the SerializedCacheValue returned is only valid
 * until your afterUpdate method returns. It is not safe to store instances of this class and use
 * them later when using off heap storage. Attempts to access off-heap data from this event after it
 * has expired will result in an IllegalStateException.
