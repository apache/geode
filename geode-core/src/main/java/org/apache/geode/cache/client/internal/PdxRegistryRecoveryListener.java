/**
 * A listener which will wipe out the PDX registry on the client side if the entire server
 * distributed system was lost and came back on line. <br>
 * <br>
 * TODO - There is a window in which all of the servers could crash and come back up and we would
 * connect to a new server before realizing that all the servers crashed. To fix this, we would need
 * to get some kind of birthdate of the server ds we connect and use that to decide if we need to
 * recover the PDX registry.
 * 
 * We can also lose connectivity with the servers, even if the servers are still running. Maybe for
 * the PDX registry we need some way of telling if the PDX registry was lost at the server side in
 * the interval.
