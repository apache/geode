/**
 * Implementers of interface <code>PartitionResolver</code> enable custom standard partitioning on
 * the <code>PartitionedRegion</code>.<br>
 * See <code>FixedPartitionResolver</code> to enable custom fixed partitioning.<br>
 * <p>
 * 1. The key class can implement the PartitionResolver interface to enable custom partitioning. OR
 * <br>
 * 2. Configure your own PartitionResolver class in partition attributes (for instance when the key
 * is a JDK class like Integer or String). Implement the appropriate equals - For all
 * implementations, you need to be sure to code the class equals method so it properly verifies
 * equality for the PartitionResolver implementation. This might mean verifying that class names are
 * the same or that the returned routing objects are the same etc.. When you initiate the
 * partitioned region on multiple nodes, GemFire uses the equals method to ensure you are using the
 * same PartitionResolver implementation for all of the nodes for the region. OR <br>
 * 3. The callback argument passed to the Region operation methods can implement PartitionResolver.
 * This implementation restricts you to using methods that accept a cache callback argument to
 * manage the region entries. For a full list of the methods that take a callback argument, see the
 * Region Javadocs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * GemFire uses the routing object's hashCode to determine where the data is being managed. Say, for
 * example, you want to colocate all Trades by month and year.The key is implemented by TradeKey
 * class which also implements the PartitionResolver interface.
 * </p>
 * public class TradeKey implements PartitionResolver {<br>
 * &nbsp &nbsp private String tradeID;<br>
 * &nbsp &nbsp private Month month ;<br>
 * &nbsp &nbsp private Year year ;<br>
 * 
 * &nbsp &nbsp public TradingKey(){ } <br>
 * &nbsp &nbsp public TradingKey(Month month, Year year){<br>
 * &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp this.month = month;<br>
 * &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp this.year = year;<br>
 * &nbsp &nbsp } <br>
 * &nbsp &nbsp public Object getRoutingObject(EntryOperation opDetails){<br>
 * &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp return this.month + this.year;<br>
 * &nbsp &nbsp }<br>
 * }<br>
 * 
 * In the example above, all trade entries with the same month and year are guaranteed to be
 * colocated.
