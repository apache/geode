package org.apache.geode.cache.execute;

/**
 * Provides methods to send results back to the ResultCollector. A ResultSender adds the ability for
 * an execute method to send a single result back, or break its result into multiple pieces and send
 * each piece back to the calling thread's {@link ResultCollector}. For each result sent using this
 * method, {@link ResultCollector#addResult(org.apache.geode.distributed.DistributedMember, Object)}
 * is called, making that result available to the calling thread immediately.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   
 *      execute(FunctionContext context){
 *              ResultSender rs = context.getResultSender();
 *              int lastResult = -1;
 *              for(int i=0;i&lt; 10; i++) {
 *                      rs.sendResult(i);
 *              }
 *              rs.lastResult(lastResult);
 *      }
 *      
 *  Application can receive the results as they are sent using ResultSender in the above for loop.
 *  It is very important to send a last result as it informs {@link ResultCollector}
 *  to stop waiting for the result.
 * <br>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 
 * @since GemFire 6.0
 * 
 * @see ResultCollector#addResult(org.apache.geode.distributed.DistributedMember, Object)
