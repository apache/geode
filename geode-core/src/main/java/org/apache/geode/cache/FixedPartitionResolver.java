 * GemFire uses the partition name returned by
 * {@link FixedPartitionResolver#getPartitionName(EntryOperation, Set)} to determine on which member
 * the data is being managed. Say, for example, you want to partition all Trades according to
 * quarters. You can implement FixedPartitionResolver to get the name of the quarter based on the
 * date given as part of {@link org.apache.geode.cache.EntryOperation}.
