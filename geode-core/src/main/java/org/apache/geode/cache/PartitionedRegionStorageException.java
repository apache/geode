/**
 * 
 * <h3>Description of the conditions under which this exception is thrown</h3>
 * <p>
 * When a <code>PartitionedRegionStorageException</code> message contains the string:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * There are not enough data store members to create a bucket.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * A new data store must be added to the partitioned region for future bucket creation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When a <code>PartitionedRegionStorageException</code> message contains the string:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Too many data store members have refused the request to create a bucket.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * There are enough data stores, however some have refused possibly due to these conditions:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The amount of storage allocated to the partitioned region on that distributed member exceeds
 * its localMaxMemory setting.</li>
 * <li>The partitioned region instance on that distributed member has been closed or destroyed.</li>
 * <li>The cache on that distributed member has been closed.</li>
 * <li>The distributed system on that member has been disconnected.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When a <code>PartitionedRegionStorageException</code> message contains the string:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Creation of a bucket for partitioned region failed in N attempts.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * If the number of attempts is lesser than the number of available data store members, contact
 * GemFire support providing all logs and statistics files from all members containing the
 * partitioned region. Otherwise, shutdown and then restart one or more of the data stores, given
 * that it is safe to do so, for example when redundantCopies is greater than 0.
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * @see org.apache.geode.cache.PartitionAttributesFactory
 * @since GemFire 5.0
