/**
 * Thrown when a paritioned region is configured for disk persistence, and part of the data is
 * stored on members that are known to be offline.
 * 
 * With a partitioned region, the keyspace is segmented into buckets which are assigned to
 * individual members. If all members that are storing data for a particular bucket are offline, any
 * attempt to access or update data in that bucket will throw this exception.
 * 
 * If you see this exception, that means that you need to restart the members that host the missing
 * data.
 * 
 * If you receive this exception when attempting an operation that modifies the region (such as a
 * put), it is possible that the change was actually persisted to disk before the member went
 * offline.
