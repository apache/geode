/**
 * Manages subregions and cached data. Each region can contain multiple subregions and entries for
 * data. Regions provide a hierarchical name space within the cache. Also, a region can be used to
 * group cached objects for management purposes.
 * <p>
 *
 * The Region interface basically contains two set of APIs: Region management APIs; and
 * (potentially) distributed operations on entries. Non-distributed operations on entries are
 * provided by the inner interface, {@link org.apache.geode.cache.Region.Entry}.
 * <p>
 *
 * Each {@link org.apache.geode.cache.Cache} defines a single top region called the root region.
 * User applications can use the root region to create subregions for isolated name space and object
 * grouping.
 * <p>
 *
 * A region's name can be any String except that it should not contain the region name separator, a
 * forward slash (/).
 *
 * <code>Region</code>s can be referenced by a relative path name from any region higher in the
 * hierarchy in {@link #getSubregion}. You can get the relative path from the root region with
 * {@link #getFullPath}. The name separator is used to concatenate all the region names together
 * from the root, starting with the root's subregions.
 * <p>
 * Relative region names can provide a convenient method to locate a subregion directly from some
 * higher region. For example, a region structure is as follows: a region named
 * <i>3rd_level_region</i> has parent region <i>2nd_level_region</i>; region <i>2nd_level_region</i>
 * in turn has parent region <i>1st_level_region</i>; and region <i>1st_level_region</i> is a child
 * of the root region. Then,the user can get the region <i>3rd_level_region</i> from the root region
 * by issuing:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  <code>
 *  region3 = root.getSubregion("1st_level_region/2nd_level_region/3rd_level_region");
 *  </code>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * or the user can get the region <i>3rd_level_region</i> from region <i>1st_level_region</i> by
 * issuing
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  <code>
 *  region3 = region1.getSubregion("2nd_level_region/3rd_level_region");
 *  </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Region entries are identified by their key. Any Object can be used as a key as long as the key
 * Object is region-wide unique and implements both the equals and hashCode methods. For regions
 * with distributed scope, the key must also be Serializable.
 * <p>
 * Regions and their entries can be locked. The <code>Lock</code> obtained from
 * {@link #getRegionDistributedLock} is a distributed lock on the entire Region, and the
 * <code>Lock</code> obtained from {@link Region#getDistributedLock} is a distributed lock on the
 * individual entry.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the scope is <code>Scope.GLOBAL</code>, the methods that modify, destroy, or invalidate the
 * entries in this region will also get a distributed lock. See the documentations for
 * {@link #getDistributedLock} and {@link #getRegionDistributedLock} for details on the implicit
 * locking that occurs for regions with <code>Scope.GLOBAL</code>.
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise specified, all of these methods throw a <code>CacheClosedException</code> if the
 * Cache is closed at the time of invocation, or a <code>RegionDestroyedException</code> if this
 * region has been destroyed. Serializability Requirements for arguments: Several methods in the
 * region API take parameters such as key, value and callback parameters.All of these parameters are
 * typed as objects. For distributed regions, keys, values and callback parameters have to be
 * serializable Failure to meet these serialization requirements causes API methods to throw
 * IllegalArgumentException.
 * <p>
 * Implementation of the java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap interface was added in version 6.5.
 * These methods give various levels of concurrency guarantees based on the scope and data policy of
 * the region. They are implemented in the peer cache and client/server cache but are disallowed in
 * peer Regions having NORMAL or EMPTY data policies.
 * <p>
 * The semantics of the ConcurrentMap methods on a Partitioned Region are consistent with those
 * expected on a ConcurrentMap. In particular multiple writers in different JVMs of the same key in
 * the same Partitioned Region will be done atomically.
 * <p>
 * The same is true for a region with GLOBAL scope. All operations will be done atomically since a
 * distributed lock will be held while the operation is done.
 * <p>
 * The same is true for a region with LOCAL scope. All ops will be done atomically since the
 * underlying map is a concurrent hash map and no distribution is involved.
 * <p>
 * For peer REPLICATE and PRELOADED regions atomicity is limited to threads in the JVM the operation
 * starts in. There is no coordination with other members of the system unless the operation is
 * performed in a transaction.
 * <p>
 * For client server regions the atomicity is determined by the scope and data policy of the server
 * region as described above. The operation is actually performed on the server as described above.
 * Clients will always send the ConcurrentMap operation to the server and the result returned by the
 * ConcurrentMap method in client will reflect what was done on the server. Same goes for any
 * CacheListener called on the client. Any local state on the client will be updated to be
 * consistent with the state change made on the server.
