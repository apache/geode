   * When using this threshold, the VM must be launched with the <code>-Xmx</code> and
   * <code>-Xms</code> switches set to the same values. Many virtual machine implementations have
   * additional VM switches to control the behavior of the garbage collector. We suggest that you
   * investigate tuning the garbage collector when using this type of eviction controller. A
   * collector that frequently collects is needed to keep our heap usage up to date. In particular,
   * on the Sun <A href="http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc/index.html">HotSpot</a> VM, the
   * <code>-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC</code> flag needs to be set, and
   * <code>-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=N</code> should be set with N being a percentage that
   * is less than the {@link ResourceManager} critical and eviction heap thresholds.
   * 
   * The JRockit VM has similar flags, <code>-Xgc:gencon</code> and <code>-XXgcTrigger:N</code>,
   * which are required if using this feature. Please Note: the JRockit gcTrigger flag is based on
   * heap free, not heap in use like the GemFire parameter. This means you need to set gcTrigger to
   * 100-N. for example, if your eviction threshold is 30 percent, you will need to set gcTrigger to
   * 70 percent.
   * 
   * On the IBM VM, the flag to get a similar collector is <code>-Xgcpolicy:gencon</code>, but there
   * is no corollary to the gcTrigger/CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction flags, so when using this
   * feature with an IBM VM, the heap usage statistics might lag the true memory usage of the VM,
   * and thresholds may need to be set sufficiently high that the VM will initiate GC before the
   * thresholds are crossed.
