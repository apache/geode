Virtual Machine using familiar Java classes and programming

<H1>GemFire Distributed Object Caching</H1>

<P>GemFire's distributed caching allows application access to
distributed and cached data across multiple physical machines.
GemFire's main API for accessing distributed data is the {@linkplain
com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.Region}

<P>GemFire provides a flexible and powerful API for distributed object
caching.  The API is particularly well-suited for caching application
data and contains classes for receiving data events, reading and
writing data to and from external sources, querying cached data using
OQL, performing transactional operations, and active monitoring of
data and data VMs.</P>

<P>A discussion of the Distributed Caching API and GemFire's
implementation of it can be found {@linkplain
com.gemstone.gemfire.cache here}.</P>
