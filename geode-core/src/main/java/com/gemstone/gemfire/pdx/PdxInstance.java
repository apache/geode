/**
 * PdxInstance provides run time access to the fields of a PDX without 
 * deserializing the PDX. Preventing deserialization saves time
 * and memory and does not require the domain class.
 * This interface is implemented by GemFire. The PdxInstance implementation 
 * is a light weight wrapper that simply refers to the raw bytes of the PDX 
 * that are kept in the cache.
 * Applications can choose to access PdxInstances instead of Java objects by 
 * configuring the Cache to prefer PDX instances during deserialization. 
 * This can be done in <code>cache.xml</code> by setting the attribute <code>read-serialized</code> 
 * to true on the <code>pdx</code> element. Or it can be done programmatically using
 * either the {@link CacheFactory#setPdxReadSerialized(boolean) setPdxReadSerialized}
 * or {@link ClientCacheFactory#setPdxReadSerialized(boolean) client setPdxReadSerialized}
 * method. Once this preference is configured, then any time deserialization of a 
 * PDX is done it will deserialize into a PdxInstance.
 * <P>PdxInstances are immutable. If you want to change one call
 * {@link #createWriter}.
 * <p>
 * A PdxInstance's fields will always be those of the version it represents.
 * So if you add a field to your domain class you can end up with a PdxInstance
 * for version 1 (that does not have the field) and a PdxInstance for version 2.
 * The PdxInstance for version 1 will not have the added field and the PdxInstance
 * for version 2 will have the field. This differs from deserialization of a pdx
 * back to a domain class. In that case if version 2 is deserializing version 1
 * PdxReader will return a default value for the added field even though version 1
 * has no knowledge of it.
