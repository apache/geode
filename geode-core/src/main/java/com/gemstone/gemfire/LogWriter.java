/**
  * Defines methods available to clients that want to write a log message
  * to their GemFire distributed system log file.
  * <p>
  * Instances of this interface can be obtained by calling
  * {@link DistributedSystem#getLogWriter}.
  * <p>
  * For any logged message the log file will contain:
  * <ul>
  * <li> The message's level.
  * <li> The time the message was logged.
  * <li> The id of the thread that logged the message.
  * <li> The message itself which can be a string and/or an exception
  *      including the exception's stack trace.
  * </ul>
  * <p>
  * A message always has a level.
  * Logging levels are ordered. Enabling logging at a given level also
  * enables logging at higher levels. The higher the level the more
  * important and urgent the message.
  * <p>
  * The levels, in descending order, are:
  * <ul>
  * <li> <code>severe</code>  (highest value) is a message level indicating a serious failure.
  *   In general <code>severe</code> messages should describe events that
  *   are of considerable importance and which will prevent normal program
  *   execution. They should be reasonably intelligible to end users and
  *   to information managers.
  * <li> <code>error</code>  
  *   In general <code>error</code> messages should describe events that
  *   are of considerable importance but will not prevent normal program
  *   execution. They should be reasonably intelligible to end users and
  *   to information managers. They are weaker than <code>severe</code> and
  *   stronger than <code>warning</code>.
  * <li> <code>warning</code> is a message level indicating a potential problem.
  *   In general <code>warning</code> messages should describe events that
  *   will be of interest to end users or information managers, or which indicate
  *   potential problems.
  * <li> <code>info</code> is a message level for informational messages.
  *   Typically <code>info</code> messages should be reasonably significant
  *   and should make sense to end users and system administrators.
  * <li> <code>config</code> is a message level for static configuration messages.
  *   <code>config</code> messages are intended to provide a variety of static
  *   configuration information, to assist in debugging problems that may be
  *   associated with particular configurations.
  * <li> <code>fine</code> is a message level providing tracing information.
  *   In general the <code>fine</code> level should be used for information
  *   that will be broadly interesting to developers. This level is for
  *   the lowest volume, and most important, tracing messages.
  * <li> <code>finer</code> indicates a fairly detailed tracing message.
  *   Logging calls for entering, returning, or throwing an exception
  *   are traced at the <code>finer</code> level.
  * <li> <code>finest</code> (lowest value) indicates a highly detailed tracing message.
  *   In general the <code>finest</code> level should be used for the most
  *   voluminous detailed tracing messages.
  * </ul>
  * <p>
  * For each level methods exist that will request a message, at that
  * level, to be logged. These methods are all named after their level.
  * <p>
  * For each level a method exists that returns a boolean indicating
  * if messages at that level will currently be logged. The names
  * of these methods are of the form: <em>level</em><code>Enabled</code>.
