 * you now must implement <code>newInstance(DataInput)</code>.
 * The addition of the <code>DataInput</code> parameter allows the instance
 * creator to optionally read data from the data input stream and use it to
 * decide the instance to create. This allows a value that represents a
 * canonical instance to be written by a class's {@link DataSerializer#toData}
 * and then be read by <code>newInstance(DataInput)</code>
 * and map it back to a canonical instance.
 * <p>
 * Note that {@link DataSerializer#fromData} is always called on the instance
 * returned from <code>newInstance(DataInput)</code>.
