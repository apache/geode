 * calculating sizes, but it should accurately reflect the amount of heap memory
 * used for objects.

 * This class will traverse all objects that are reachable from the passed in
 * object by instance fields. So use this class with caution if you have
 * instance fields that refer to shared objects.
 * 
 * For objects that are all approximately the same size, consider using
