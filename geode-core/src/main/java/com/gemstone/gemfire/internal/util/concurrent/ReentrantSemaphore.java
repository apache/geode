/**
 * A special purpose semaphore that allows reentrancy. With this semaphore, a thread
 * will only acquire a real permit the first time it calls acquire. After that, the
 * thread can call acquire repeatedly, and it won't affect the semaphore count until
 * the thread calls release the same number of times as acquire.
 * 
 * This semaphore currently only supports a thread acquiring and releasing a single permit at
 * a time.
 * 
 * If a thread does not hold the semaphore, but still decrements it, then it will increase the
 * permits of the semaphore, just like a regular semaphore.
 * 
 * This semaphore is useful for allowing only a limited number of threads to enter a block of code,
 * while allowing a single thread to try to enter that block several times in it's call stack.
