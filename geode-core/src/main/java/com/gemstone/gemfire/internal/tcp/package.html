Contains TCP/IP communications conduit
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The tcp/ip conduit is designed to be used in one way:</p>

</p>1) The conduit is used by the GemFire
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.DistributionChannel}
when true multicast messaging is not needed.  When used in this way, the
conduit manages the serialization and transmission of
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.DistributionMessage}
objects from one system to another.  The
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.DistributionManager}
maintains a
Map of JavaGroups Addresses to the corresponding tcp/ip address for each
system.  The <code>DistributionManager</code> also maintains a set of
known tcp/ip addresses that the conduit uses for fast iteration when simulating
multicast message transmission.</p>

<hr>

<p>Messaging uses Java serialization to send messages (and
receive replies).
<hr>

<p>The GemFire JCache implementation initializes a <code>TCPConduit</code> when the
cache is initialized.
<code>TCPConduit</code>s created by the
cache use a wildcard bind to select a server port unless the property
tcpServerPort is set.  If you're building a service using <code>TCPConduit</code>
you may want to use a fixed port so that if your service exits it can
restart on the same port.</p>

<hr>

<p>The design of the conduit is fairly simple.  <code>TCPConduit</code> owns the
{@link java.net.ServerSocket} that accepts connections from other conduits.
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.tcp.Connection "Connections"}
are kept in a
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.tcp.ConnectionTable ConnectionTable}.
</p>

<p>The use of NIO can be turned off with the property <code>p2p.oldIO=true</code>.
This will force the use of sockets instead of socket channels.
Each <code>Connection</code> always creates a reader thread for pulling information out
of its socket.</p>

<p>NIO and oldIO communications are interoperable</p>

<p><code>TCPConduit</code> is used to send and receive messages using
endpoint <code>Stubs</code> holding target host/port information. The conduit
uses this information to select the correct <code>Connection</code>,
or to create a new one if necessary.  When sending a message, the
conduit passes the message to the <code>Connection</code> and waits
until transmission is complete before returning.  Messages and
responses received by a <code>Connection</code> are passed to the
<code>TCPConduit</code> which routes them to their final
destination.</p>

<p>When a message is received from another conduit it is deserialized
and examined.  If it is a <code>DistributionMessage</code>, the message is delegated
to the <code>DirectChannel</code> held by the <code>DistributionManager</code>.  
</p>

   TCPConduit  ----->  ConnectionTable
                       |     |     |
                       v     v     v
                        Connections
</code></pre>
<hr>

<p>When a Connection is formed between two conduits, the client side
(the one initiating the connection) transmits its <code>TCPConduit's</code>
<code>ServerSocket</code> port.  This port is used to identify the connection instead
of the regular socket port.  This allows all <code>Connection</code> objects to be
identified by their associated server ports and makes connection management
much simpler.</p>

<hr>
<p>Other property settings that affect the conduit:</p><pre>

  p2p.tcpBufferSize - the size of operating system buffers on the tcp socket.
      outgoing messages.  The default is 32768.

  p2p.readerBufferSize - the size of the buffer used by reader threads
      to buffer incoming data.  The default is 32768.

  p2p.VERBOSE - turn on verbose logging at finer and finest log settings
  
  p2p.defaultLogLevel - level of logging to use if there is no distribution
      manager or gemfire log writer.  The value is "info", "config", "fine"
      etc
  
  p2p.DEBUG - turn on VERBOSE and defaultLogLevel of "finest"
  
  p2p.oldIO - turn off the use of java.nio for I/O operations.  If there is
      a custom socket implementation being used in the VM that doesn't support
      NIO you might want to use this property.
  
  p2p.useSSL - causes the conduit to use the javax.ssl JSSE factory to create
      its server socket.  This also sets p2p.oldIO=true since SSL sockets
      don't currently seem to support NIO.  TCPConduit has the method
      getSSLSession(serverId) that can be used to retrieve the SSL
      session for a given connection.  The serverId argument is a stub.

  p2p.idleConnectionTimeout - how long a thread owned connection can be idle
      before it will be closed.

</pre>
<p>Some of these properties are instance-specific and can be set when you
create the conduit by passing a {@link java.util.Properties} object with the settings. When
you use this form of the <code>TCPConduit</code> constructor, the conduit will not
search for these settings in system properties:</p><pre>

      p2p.tcpBufferSize
      p2p.idleConnectionTimeout

</pre>
