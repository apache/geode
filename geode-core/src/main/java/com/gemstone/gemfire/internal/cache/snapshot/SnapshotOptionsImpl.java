   * of a partitioned region to save its local data set (ignoring redundant 
   * copies) to a separate snapshot file.  During a parallel import, each member
   * may read from one or more snapshot files created during a parallel export.
   * <p>
   * Parallelizing snapshot operations may yield significant performance
   * improvements for large data sets.  This is particularly true when each 
   * member is reading from or writing to separate physical disks.
   * <p>
   * This flag is ignored for replicated regions.
   * <p>
   * If the mapper is not set explicitly, a default mapping implementation is used
   * that assumes each member can access a non-shared disk volume.  The default
   * mapper provides the following behavior:
   * <dl>
   *  <dt>export</dt>
   *  <dd>use the supplied path</dd>
   *  <dt>import</dt>
   *  <dd>if the supplied path is a file, use that file</dd>
   *  <dd>if the supplied path is a directory, use all files in the directory</dd>
   * </dl>
   * If processes are colocated on the same machine and relative pathnames are
   * not used, a custom mapper <b>must</b> be supplied to disambiguate filenames.
   * This rule applies when writing to a shared network volume as well.
