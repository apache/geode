    /*
     * Overview:
     *
     * The primary design goal of this hash table is to maintain
     * concurrent readability (typically method get(), but also
     * iterators and related methods) while minimizing update
     * contention. Secondary goals are to keep space consumption about
     * the same or better than java.util.HashMap, and to support high
     * initial insertion rates on an empty table by many threads.
     *
     * This map usually acts as a binned (bucketed) hash table.  Each
     * key-value mapping is held in a Node.  Most nodes are instances
     * of the basic Node class with hash, key, value, and next
     * fields. However, various subclasses exist: TreeNodes are
     * arranged in balanced trees, not lists.  TreeBins hold the roots
     * of sets of TreeNodes. ForwardingNodes are placed at the heads
     * of bins during resizing. ReservationNodes are used as
     * placeholders while establishing values in computeIfAbsent and
     * related methods.  The types TreeBin, ForwardingNode, and
     * ReservationNode do not hold normal user keys, values, or
     * hashes, and are readily distinguishable during search etc
     * because they have negative hash fields and null key and value
     * fields. (These special nodes are either uncommon or transient,
     * so the impact of carrying around some unused fields is
     * insignificant.)
     *
     * The table is lazily initialized to a power-of-two size upon the
     * first insertion.  Each bin in the table normally contains a
     * list of Nodes (most often, the list has only zero or one Node).
     * Table accesses require volatile/atomic reads, writes, and
     * CASes.  Because there is no other way to arrange this without
     * adding further indirections, we use intrinsics
     * (sun.misc.Unsafe) operations.
     *
     * We use the top (sign) bit of Node hash fields for control
     * purposes -- it is available anyway because of addressing
     * constraints.  Nodes with negative hash fields are specially
     * handled or ignored in map methods.
     *
     * Insertion (via put or its variants) of the first node in an
     * empty bin is performed by just CASing it to the bin.  This is
     * by far the most common case for put operations under most
     * key/hash distributions.  Other update operations (insert,
     * delete, and replace) require locks.  We do not want to waste
     * the space required to associate a distinct lock object with
     * each bin, so instead use the first node of a bin list itself as
     * a lock. Locking support for these locks relies on builtin
     * "synchronized" monitors.
     *
     * Using the first node of a list as a lock does not by itself
     * suffice though: When a node is locked, any update must first
     * validate that it is still the first node after locking it, and
     * retry if not. Because new nodes are always appended to lists,
     * once a node is first in a bin, it remains first until deleted
     * or the bin becomes invalidated (upon resizing).
     *
     * The main disadvantage of per-bin locks is that other update
     * operations on other nodes in a bin list protected by the same
     * lock can stall, for example when user equals() or mapping
     * functions take a long time.  However, statistically, under
     * random hash codes, this is not a common problem.  Ideally, the
     * frequency of nodes in bins follows a Poisson distribution
     * (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) with a
     * parameter of about 0.5 on average, given the resizing threshold
     * of 0.75, although with a large variance because of resizing
     * granularity. Ignoring variance, the expected occurrences of
     * list size k are (exp(-0.5) * pow(0.5, k) / factorial(k)). The
     * first values are:
     *
     * 0:    0.60653066
     * 1:    0.30326533
     * 2:    0.07581633
     * 3:    0.01263606
     * 4:    0.00157952
     * 5:    0.00015795
     * 6:    0.00001316
     * 7:    0.00000094
     * 8:    0.00000006
     * more: less than 1 in ten million
     *
     * Lock contention probability for two threads accessing distinct
     * elements is roughly 1 / (8 * #elements) under random hashes.
     *
     * Actual hash code distributions encountered in practice
     * sometimes deviate significantly from uniform randomness.  This
     * includes the case when N > (1<<30), so some keys MUST collide.
     * Similarly for dumb or hostile usages in which multiple keys are
     * designed to have identical hash codes or ones that differs only
     * in masked-out high bits. So we use a secondary strategy that
     * applies when the number of nodes in a bin exceeds a
     * threshold. These TreeBins use a balanced tree to hold nodes (a
     * specialized form of red-black trees), bounding search time to
     * O(log N).  Each search step in a TreeBin is at least twice as
     * slow as in a regular list, but given that N cannot exceed
     * (1<<64) (before running out of addresses) this bounds search
     * steps, lock hold times, etc, to reasonable constants (roughly
     * 100 nodes inspected per operation worst case) so long as keys
     * are Comparable (which is very common -- String, Long, etc).
     * TreeBin nodes (TreeNodes) also maintain the same "next"
     * traversal pointers as regular nodes, so can be traversed in
     * iterators in the same way.
     *
     * The table is resized when occupancy exceeds a percentage
     * threshold (nominally, 0.75, but see below).  Any thread
     * noticing an overfull bin may assist in resizing after the
     * initiating thread allocates and sets up the replacement array.
     * However, rather than stalling, these other threads may proceed
     * with insertions etc.  The use of TreeBins shields us from the
     * worst case effects of overfilling while resizes are in
     * progress.  Resizing proceeds by transferring bins, one by one,
     * from the table to the next table. However, threads claim small
     * blocks of indices to transfer (via field transferIndex) before
     * doing so, reducing contention.  A generation stamp in field
     * sizeCtl ensures that resizings do not overlap. Because we are
     * using power-of-two expansion, the elements from each bin must
     * either stay at same index, or move with a power of two
     * offset. We eliminate unnecessary node creation by catching
     * cases where old nodes can be reused because their next fields
     * won't change.  On average, only about one-sixth of them need
     * cloning when a table doubles. The nodes they replace will be
     * garbage collectable as soon as they are no longer referenced by
     * any reader thread that may be in the midst of concurrently
     * traversing table.  Upon transfer, the old table bin contains
     * only a special forwarding node (with hash field "MOVED") that
     * contains the next table as its key. On encountering a
     * forwarding node, access and update operations restart, using
     * the new table.
     *
     * Each bin transfer requires its bin lock, which can stall
     * waiting for locks while resizing. However, because other
     * threads can join in and help resize rather than contend for
     * locks, average aggregate waits become shorter as resizing
     * progresses.  The transfer operation must also ensure that all
     * accessible bins in both the old and new table are usable by any
     * traversal.  This is arranged in part by proceeding from the
     * last bin (table.length - 1) up towards the first.  Upon seeing
     * a forwarding node, traversals (see class Traverser) arrange to
     * move to the new table without revisiting nodes.  To ensure that
     * no intervening nodes are skipped even when moved out of order,
     * a stack (see class TableStack) is created on first encounter of
     * a forwarding node during a traversal, to maintain its place if
     * later processing the current table. The need for these
     * save/restore mechanics is relatively rare, but when one
     * forwarding node is encountered, typically many more will be.
     * So Traversers use a simple caching scheme to avoid creating so
     * many new TableStack nodes. (Thanks to Peter Levart for
     * suggesting use of a stack here.)
     *
     * The traversal scheme also applies to partial traversals of
     * ranges of bins (via an alternate Traverser constructor)
     * to support partitioned aggregate operations.  Also, read-only
     * operations give up if ever forwarded to a null table, which
     * provides support for shutdown-style clearing, which is also not
     * currently implemented.
     *
     * Lazy table initialization minimizes footprint until first use,
     * and also avoids resizings when the first operation is from a
     * putAll, constructor with map argument, or deserialization.
     * These cases attempt to override the initial capacity settings,
     * but harmlessly fail to take effect in cases of races.
     *
     * The element count is maintained using a specialization of
     * LongAdder. We need to incorporate a specialization rather than
     * just use a LongAdder in order to access implicit
     * contention-sensing that leads to creation of multiple
     * CounterCells.  The counter mechanics avoid contention on
     * updates but can encounter cache thrashing if read too
     * frequently during concurrent access. To avoid reading so often,
     * resizing under contention is attempted only upon adding to a
     * bin already holding two or more nodes. Under uniform hash
     * distributions, the probability of this occurring at threshold
     * is around 13%, meaning that only about 1 in 8 puts check
     * threshold (and after resizing, many fewer do so).
     *
     * TreeBins use a special form of comparison for search and
     * related operations (which is the main reason we cannot use
     * existing collections such as TreeMaps). TreeBins contain
     * Comparable elements, but may contain others, as well as
     * elements that are Comparable but not necessarily Comparable for
     * the same T, so we cannot invoke compareTo among them. To handle
     * this, the tree is ordered primarily by hash value, then by
     * Comparable.compareTo order if applicable.  On lookup at a node,
     * if elements are not comparable or compare as 0 then both left
     * and right children may need to be searched in the case of tied
     * hash values. (This corresponds to the full list search that
     * would be necessary if all elements were non-Comparable and had
     * tied hashes.) On insertion, to keep a total ordering (or as
     * close as is required here) across rebalancings, we compare
     * classes and identityHashCodes as tie-breakers. The red-black
     * balancing code is updated from pre-jdk-collections
     * (http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/collections/RBCell.java)
     * based in turn on Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest "Introduction to
     * Algorithms" (CLR).
     *
     * TreeBins also require an additional locking mechanism.  While
     * list traversal is always possible by readers even during
     * updates, tree traversal is not, mainly because of tree-rotations
     * that may change the root node and/or its linkages.  TreeBins
     * include a simple read-write lock mechanism parasitic on the
     * main bin-synchronization strategy: Structural adjustments
     * associated with an insertion or removal are already bin-locked
     * (and so cannot conflict with other writers) but must wait for
     * ongoing readers to finish. Since there can be only one such
     * waiter, we use a simple scheme using a single "waiter" field to
     * block writers.  However, readers need never block.  If the root
     * lock is held, they proceed along the slow traversal path (via
     * next-pointers) until the lock becomes available or the list is
     * exhausted, whichever comes first. These cases are not fast, but
     * maximize aggregate expected throughput.
     *
     * Maintaining API and serialization compatibility with previous
     * versions of this class introduces several oddities. Mainly: We
     * leave untouched but unused constructor arguments refering to
     * concurrencyLevel. We accept a loadFactor constructor argument,
     * but apply it only to initial table capacity (which is the only
     * time that we can guarantee to honor it.) We also declare an
     * unused "Segment" class that is instantiated in minimal form
     * only when serializing.
     *
     * Also, solely for compatibility with previous versions of this
     * class, it extends AbstractMap, even though all of its methods
     * are overridden, so it is just useless baggage.
     *
     * This file is organized to make things a little easier to follow
     * while reading than they might otherwise: First the main static
     * declarations and utilities, then fields, then main public
     * methods (with a few factorings of multiple public methods into
     * internal ones), then sizing methods, trees, traversers, and
     * bulk operations.
