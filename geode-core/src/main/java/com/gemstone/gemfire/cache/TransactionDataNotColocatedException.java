/**
 * Indicates that an attempt was made to transactionally modify multiple keys that

 * the initiator of the transaction.
 *
 * <p>Note: a rebalance can cause this exception to be thrown for data that
 * is usually colocated. This is because data can be moved from one node to another
 * during the time between the original transactional operations and the commit.
