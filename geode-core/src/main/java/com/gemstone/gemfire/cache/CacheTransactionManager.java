/** <p>The CacheTransactionManager interface allows applications to manage
 * transactions on a per {@link Cache} basis.  
 * 
 * <p>The life cycle of a GemFire transaction starts with a begin
 * operation. The life cycle ends with either a commit or rollback
 * operation.  Between the begin and the commit/rollback are typically
 * {@link Region} operations.  In general, those that either create,
 * destroy, invalidate or update {@link Region.Entry} are considered
 * transactional, that is they modify transactional state.
 * 
 * <p>A GemFire transaction may involve operations on multiple regions,
 * each of which may have different attributes.
 * 
 * <p>While a GemFire transaction and its operations are invoked in
 * the local VM, the resulting transaction state is distributed to
 * other VM's at commit time as per the attributes of each
 * participant Region.
 * 
 * <p>A transaction can have no more than one thread associated with
 * it and conversely a thread can only operate on one transaction at
 * any given time. Child threads will not inherit the existing
 * transaction.
 *
 * <p>Each of the following methods operate on the current thread.  All
 * methods throw {@link CacheClosedException} if the Cache is closed.
 * 
 * <p>GemFire Transactions currently only support Read Committed
 * isolation.  In addition, they are optimistic transactions in that
 * write locking and conflict checks are performed as part of the
 * commit operation.
 *
 * <p>For guaranteed Read Committed isolation, avoid making "in place"
 * changes, because such changes will be "seen" by other transactions
 * and break the Read Committed isolation guarantee. e.g.
 *
 *  <pre>
 *    CacheTransactionManager txMgr = cache.getCacheTransactionManager();
 *    txMgr.begin();
 *    StringBuffer s = (StringBuffer) r.get("stringBuf");
 *    s.append("Changes seen before commit. NOT Read Committed!");
 *    r.put("stringBuf", s);
 *    txMgr.commit();
 *  </pre>
 * 
 *  <p>To aid in creating copies, the "copy on read"
 *  <code>Cache</code> attribute and the {@link
 *  com.gemstone.gemfire.CopyHelper#copy} method are provided.
 *  The following is a Read Committed safe example using the
 *  <code>CopyHelper.copy</code> method.
 * 
 *  <pre>
 *    CacheTransactionManager txMgr = cache.getCacheTransactionManager();
 *    txMgr.begin();
 *    Object o = r.get("stringBuf");
 *    StringBuffer s = (StringBuffer) CopyHelper.copy(o);
 *    s.append("Changes unseen before commit. Read Committed.");
 *    r.put("stringBuf", s);
 *    txMgr.commit();
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  <p>Its important to note that creating copies can negatively
 *  impact both performance and memory consumption.
 *
 * <p>Partitioned Regions, Distributed No Ack and Distributed Ack Regions are supported
 * (see {@link AttributesFactory} for Scope).  For both scopes, a
 * consistent configuration (per VM) is enforced.
 * 
 * <p>Global Regions, client Regions (see com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client package)
 * and persistent Regions (see {@link DiskWriteAttributes}) do not
 * support transactions.
 * 
 * <p>When PartitionedRegions are involved in a transaction, all data in the 
 * transaction must be colocated together on one data node. See the GemFire 
 * Developer Guide for details on using transactions with Partitioned Regions.
