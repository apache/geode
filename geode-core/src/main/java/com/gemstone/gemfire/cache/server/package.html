  <BODY>
  The <code>com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.server</code> package provides APIs used
  for the server side of client/server caching.
<p>
A {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.server.CacheServer cache server} can be
declared using the <code>cache-server</code> element described in the
<code>cache6_5.dtd</code>.
<p>
Or it can be created by calling {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.Cache#addCacheServer}.
<p>
Another option is to use the <code>cacheserver</code> executable which can be found
in the GemFire <code>bin</code> directory.
<p>
To obtain an instance of <code>CacheServer</code> that has already been created
use {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.Cache#getCacheServers}.
<p>
See the <a href="{@docRoot}/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/client/package-summary.html#package_description">client</a> package for information
on how to create clients that will connect to and access the cache in your
cache server.
