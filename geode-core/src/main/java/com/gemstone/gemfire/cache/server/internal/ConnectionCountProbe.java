/**
 * A load probe which returns load as a function of the
 * number of connections to the bridge server.
 * 
 * The Load object returned by this probe reports the 
 * connection load as the number of connections to this
 * server divided by the max connections for this server. This
 * means that servers with a lower max connections will receive
 * fewer connections than servers with a higher max connections.
 * The load therefore is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means there
 * are are no connections, and 1 means the server at max connections.
 * 
 * The queue load is reported simply as the number of queues
 * hosted by this bridge server.
