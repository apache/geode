/**
 * A pool for connections from a client to a set of GemFire Cache Servers.
 * <p>A single instance of this interface can be created using {@link ClientCacheFactory#create}.
 * Multiple instances may also be created using
 * {@link PoolFactory#create}.
 * A {@link PoolFactory} instance is created by calling
 * {@link PoolManager#createFactory}. So to create a default <code>Pool</code> do this:
 * <PRE>
     new ClientCacheFactory().create();
 * </PRE>
 * or this:
 * <PRE>
     PoolManager.createFactory().create("myPool");
 * </PRE>
 * Instances may also be created by declaring them in cache.xml with a <code>pool</code> element.
 * <p>Existing Pool instances can be found using {@link PoolManager#find(String)}
 * and {@link PoolManager#getAll}.
 * <p>The pool name must be configured
 * on the client regions that will use this pool by calling
 * {@link RegionFactory#setPoolName}.
