 * For eviction-policy <b>none</b> client queue entries are not evicted to disk <br></LI>
 * <LI>For eviction-policy <b>mem</b> client queue entries are evicted to disk when limit is

 * <LI>For eviction-policy <b>entry</b> HA entries are evicted to disk when limit is

 * </UL>

 * 
 * The capacity limits the total amount of memory or entries for all client queues
 * on held on this server. If this server hosts multiple client queues, they will
 * all share the same capacity.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Configuration: </b>
 * <p>
 * The <code>client queue</code> is configurable declaratively or
 * programmatically. Declarative configuration is achieved through defining the
 * configuration parameters in a <code>cache.xml</code> file. Programmatic
 * configuration may be achieved by first instantiating a
 * <code>CacheServer</code> object and get {@link CacheServer#getClientSubscriptionConfig} 
 * <code>ClientSubscriptionConfig</code> object and modify each desired parameter and value.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * If you are using a <code>cache.xml</code> file to create a
 * <code>CacheServer</code> declaratively, you can do the following to configure
 * <code>ClientSubscriptionConfig</code> and to have <b>none</b> eviction policy 
 * no need to specify client-subscription tag as it is a default one.
 *</p>
 *
 *<pre>
 *<code>
 * &lt;cache-server port=4444&gt;
 *   &lt;client-subscription eviction-policy=&quot;entry | mem&quot; capacity=35 overflow-directory=&quot;OverflowDir&quot;&gt;&lt;/client-subscription&gt;
 * &lt;/cache-server&gt;
