/**
 * Allows a snapshot of cache data to be imported and exported. Each region in 
 * the cache will be included in the snapshot (one snapshot file for each
 * region). Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // obtain a snapshot
 * CacheSnapshotService snapshot = cache.getSnapshotService();
 * 
 * // export the snapshot, every region in the cache will be exported
 * snapshot.save(new File("."), SnapshotFormat.GEMFIRE);
 * 
 * // import the snapshot files, updates any existing entries in the cache
 * snapshot.load(new File("."), SnapshotFormat.GEMFIRE);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The default behavior is to perform all I/O operations on the node where the
 * snapshot operations are invoked.  This will involve either collecting or
 * dispersing data over the network if the cache contains a partitioned region.
 * The snapshot behavior can be changed using {@link SnapshotOptions}. For example:
 * <pre>
 * CacheSnapshotService snapshot = cache.getSnapshotService();
 * SnapshotFilter filter = new SnapshotFilter() {
 *   public boolean accept(Entry<K, V> entry) {
 *     return true;
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * SnapshotOptions<Object, Object> options = snapshot.createOptions();
 * options.setFilter(filter);
 * 
 * snapshot.save(new File("."), SnapshotFormat.GEMFIRE, options);
 * </pre>
 * Note that the snapshot does not provide a consistency guarantee. Updates to 
 * data during the course of import/export operations could result data 
 * inconsistencies.
