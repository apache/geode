/**
 * Enumerated type for region data policy.
 * The data policy specifies how this local cache will handle the data for a region.
 * <ol>
 * <li><code>EMPTY</code> causes data to never be stored in local memory. The region will always appear empty. It can be used to for zero footprint producers that only want to distribute their data to others and for zero footprint consumers that only want to see events.
 * <li><code>NORMAL</code> causes data that this region is interested in to be stored in local memory. It allows the contents in this cache to differ from other caches.
 * <li><code>PARTITION</code> causes data that this region holds to be spread across processes.  The amount of data held in this cache is configured in {@link PartitionAttributes} with a {@link PartitionAttributesFactory}.
 * <li><code>PERSISTENT_PARTITION</code> in addition to <code>PARTITION</code> also causes data to be stored to disk. The region initialization uses the data stored on disk.
 * <li><code>REPLICATE</code> causes data that this region is interested in to be stored in local memory. A distributed region will be initialized with the data from other caches. On distributed region operations that would cause the contents to differ with other caches are not allowed. This policy is allowed on local scope region but it behaves the same as <code>NORMAL</code>.
 * <li><code>PERSISTENT_REPLICATE</code> in addition to <code>REPLICATE</code> also causes data to be stored to disk. The region initialization uses the data stored on disk. Note that the persistence applies to both local scope and distributed scope.
 * <li><code>HDFS_PARTITION</code> in addition to <code>PARTITION</code> also causes data to be stored to HDFS. The region initialization may use the data stored on HDFS. 
 * </ol>
