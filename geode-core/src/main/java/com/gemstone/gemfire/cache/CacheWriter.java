/** A user-defined object defined in the {@link RegionAttributes} that is
 * called synchronously before a region or entry in the cache is
 * modified. The typical use for a <code>CacheWriter</code> is to update a database.
 * Application writers should implement these methods to execute
 * application-specific behavior before the cache is modified.
 *
 * <p>Before the region is updated via a put, create, or destroy operation,
 * GemFire will call a <code>CacheWriter</code> that is installed anywhere in any
 * participating cache for that region, preferring a local <code>CacheWriter</code>
 * if there is one. Usually there will be only one <code>CacheWriter</code> in
 * the distributed system. If there are multiple <code>CacheWriter</code>s
 * available in the distributed system, the GemFire
 * implementation always prefers one that is stored locally, or else picks one
 * arbitrarily; in any case only one <code>CacheWriter</code> will be invoked.
 *
 * <p>The <code>CacheWriter</code> is capable of aborting the update to the cache by throwing
 * a <code>CacheWriterException</code>. This exception or any runtime exception
 * thrown by the <code>CacheWriter</code> will abort the operation and the
 * exception will be propagated to the initiator of the operation, regardless
 * of whether the initiator is in the same VM as the <code>CacheWriter</code>.
