 * This error is used by GemFire for internal purposes.

 * For this reason it is named "Rethrowable" instead of the standard "Error".
 * It was made an <code>Error</code> to make it easier for user code that typically would
 * catch <code>Exception</code> to not accidently catch this exception.
 * <p> Note: if user code catches this error (or its subclasses) then it <em>must</em>
 * be rethrown.
