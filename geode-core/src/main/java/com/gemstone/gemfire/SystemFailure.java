/**
 * Catches and responds to JVM failure
 * <p>
 * This class represents a catastrophic failure of the system,
 * especially the Java virtual machine.  Any class may,
 * at any time, indicate that a system failure has occurred by calling
 * {@link #initiateFailure(Error)} (or, less commonly,
 * {@link #setFailure(Error)}).
 * <p>
 * In practice, the most common type of failure that is likely to be
 * reported by an otherwise healthy JVM is {@link OutOfMemoryError}.  However,
 * GemFire will report any occurrence of {@link VirtualMachineError} as
 * a JVM failure.
 * <p>
 * When a failure is reported, you must assume that the JVM has <em>broken 
 * its fundamental execution contract</em> with your application. 
 * No programming invariant can be assumed to be true, and your 
 * entire application must be regarded as corrupted.
 * <h1>Failure Hooks</h1>
 * GemFire uses this class to disable its distributed system (group
 * communication) and any open caches.  It also provides a hook for you
 * to respond to after GemFire disables itself.
 * <h1>Failure WatchDog</h1>
 * When {@link #startThreads()} is called, a "watchdog" {@link Thread} is started that 
 * periodically checks to see if system corruption has been reported.  When 
 * system corruption is detected, this thread proceeds to:
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <em>Close GemFire</em> -- Group communication is ceased (this cache
 * member recuses itself from the distributed system) and the cache
 * is further poisoned (it is pointless to try to cleanly close it at this
 * point.).
 * <p>
 * After this has successfully ended, we launch a
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <em>failure action</em>, a user-defined Runnable
 * {@link #setFailureAction(Runnable)}.
 * By default, this Runnable performs nothing.  If you feel you need to perform
 * an action before exiting the JVM, this hook gives you a
 * means of attempting some action.  Whatever you attempt should be extremely
 * simple, since your Java execution environment has been corrupted.
 * <p>
 * GemStone recommends that you employ 
 * <a href="http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/introduction.html">
 * Java Service Wrapper</a> to detect when your JVM exits and to perform
 * appropriate failure and restart actions.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Finally, if the application has granted the watchdog permission to exit the JVM
 * (via {@link #setExitOK(boolean)}), the watchdog calls {@link System#exit(int)} with
 * an argument of 1.  If you have not granted this class permission to
 * close the JVM, you are <em>strongly</em>  advised to call it in your
 * failure action (in the previous step).
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p> 
 * Each of these actions will be run exactly once in the above described
 * order.  However, if either step throws any type of error ({@link Throwable}), 
 * the watchdog will assume that the JVM is still under duress (esp. an 
 * {@link OutOfMemoryError}), will wait a bit, and then retry the failed action.
 * <p>
 * It bears repeating that you should be very cautious of any Runnables you
 * ask this class to run.  By definition the JVM is <em>very sick</em>
 * when failure has been signalled.  
 * <p>
 * <h1>Failure Proctor</h1>
 * In addition to the failure watchdog, {@link #startThreads()} creates a second
 * thread (the "proctor") that monitors free memory. It does this by examining
 * {@link Runtime#freeMemory() free memory},  
 * {@link Runtime#totalMemory() total memory} and 
 * {@link Runtime#maxMemory() maximum memory}.  If the amount of available 
 * memory stays below a given 
 * {@link #setFailureMemoryThreshold(long) threshold}, for
 * more than {@link #WATCHDOG_WAIT} seconds, the watchdog is notified.
 * <p>
 * Note that the proctor can be effectively disabled by
 * {@link SystemFailure#setFailureMemoryThreshold(long) setting} the failure memory threshold
 * to a negative value.
 * <p>
 * The proctor is a second line of defense, attempting to detect 
 * OutOfMemoryError conditions in circumstances where nothing alerted the
 * watchdog.  For instance, a third-party jar might incorrectly handle this
 * error and leave your virtual machine in a "stuck" state.
 * <p>
 * Note that the proctor does not relieve you of the obligation to
 * follow the best practices in the next section.
 * <h1>Best Practices</h1>
 * <h2>Catch and Handle VirtualMachineError</h2>
 * If you feel obliged to catch <em>either</em> {@link Error}, or 
 * {@link Throwable}, you <em>must</em>also check for 
 * {@link VirtualMachineError} like so:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
        catch (VirtualMachineError err) {
          SystemFailure.{@link #initiateFailure(Error) initiateFailure}(err);
          // If this ever returns, rethrow the error.  We're poisoned
          // now, so don't let this thread continue.
          throw err;
        }
 * </pre>
 * <h2>Periodically Check For Errors</h2>
 * Check for serious system errors at
 * appropriate points in your algorithms.  You may elect to use
 * the {@link #checkFailure()} utility function, but you are
 * not required to (you could just see if {@link SystemFailure#getFailure()}
 * returns a non-null result).  
 * <p>
 * A job processing loop is a good candidate, for
 * instance, in com.gemstone.org.jgroups.protocols.UDP#run(), 
 * which implements {@link Thread#run}:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
         for (;;)  {
           SystemFailure.{@link #checkFailure() checkFailure}();
           if (mcast_recv_sock == null || mcast_recv_sock.isClosed()) break;
           if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) break;
          ...
 * </pre>
 * <h2>Create Logging ThreadGroups</h2>
 * If you create any Thread, a best practice is to catch severe errors
 * and signal failure appropriately.  One trick to do this is to create a 
 * ThreadGroup that handles uncaught exceptions by overriding 
 * {@link ThreadGroup#uncaughtException(Thread, Throwable)} and to declare 
 * your thread as a member of that {@link ThreadGroup}.  This also has a 
 * significant side-benefit in that most uncaught exceptions 
 * can be detected:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
    ThreadGroup tg = new ThreadGroup("Worker Threads") {
        public void uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable e) {
          // Do this *before* any object allocation in case of
          // OutOfMemoryError (for instance)
          if (e instanceof VirtualMachineError) {
            SystemFailure.{@link #setFailure(Error) setFailure}((VirtualMachineError)e); // don't throw
          }
          String s = "Uncaught exception in thread " + t;
          system.getLogWriter().severe(s, e);
        }
        Thread t = new Thread(myRunnable, tg, "My Thread");
        t.start();
      }; * </pre>
 * <p>
  * <h2>Catches of Error and Throwable Should Check for Failure</h2>
  * Keep in mind that peculiar or flat-out<em>impossible</em>  exceptions may 
  * ensue after a VirtualMachineError has been thrown <em>anywhere</em> in
  * your virtual machine. Whenever you catch {@link Error} or {@link Throwable}, 
  * you should also make sure that you aren't dealing with a corrupted JVM:
  * <p>
  * <pre>
        catch (Throwable t) {
          // Whenever you catch Error or Throwable, you must also
          // catch VirtualMachineError (see above).  However, there is
          // _still_ a possibility that you are dealing with a cascading
          // error condition, so you also need to check to see if the JVM
          // is still usable:
          SystemFailure.{@link #checkFailure() checkFailure}();
          ...
        }
 * </pre>
