# Download

A proposal has been submitted to The Apache Software Foundation to incubate Project Geode. Until accepted by ASF, source code is available via an evaluation-only EULA. After acceptance, we intend to release versions under an Apache V2 license.

The source for Project Geode can be downloaded here:
[Pivotal Network Project Geode Source](https://network.pivotal.io/products/project-geode).  Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki#geode-in-5-minutes) to build and run Geode.
