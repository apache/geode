This section discusses how to access and manage your CQs from your client. The calls discussed here are all executed specifically for the calling client. A client cannot access or modify the CQs belonging to another client.

## Accessing CQs and CQ Statistics

You can use the `QueryServicegetCq*` methods to access a single named CQ, an array of all CQs registered, and an array of all CQs registered in the client. You canuse the `CqEvent.getCq` method to access the CQ used to produce a `CqEvent`.

CQ runtime statistics are available for the client through the `CqServiceStatistics` and `CqStatistics` interfaces described under [CQ API and Main Features](3-native-client-cq-api.html#security). You can get information on the events generated by a specific CQ from the `CqStatistics` object returned by `CqQuery.GetStatistics`. You can get higher-level information about the CQs the client has registered, running, and so on, from the `CqServiceStatistics` object returned by `QueryService.GetCqStatistics` .

Client statistics are for the single client only. The server's pertain to all clients with CQs on this server.

## Modifying CQ Attributes

You can modify the attributes for an existing CQ using the methods provided by `CqQuery.GetCqAttributesMutator`. The attributes consist of a list of listeners.

## Stopping and Closing CQs

You stop individual CQs with the `CqQuerystop` method. You can stop all CQs for the client through the `QueryService`. Stopped CQs are in the same state as new CQs that have not yet been executed. You can close or execute a stopped CQ.

You close individual CQs with the `CqQueryclose` method. You can also close all CQs for the client through the `QueryService`. Closed CQs cannot be executed. CQs are also closed in the following cases:

-   The client closes its cache after closing all of its CQs--Closing the client cache closes the `QueryService` and all associated CQs on the client and server.
-   The client disconnects from its server--This might be because of a network outage or some other failure. When a client disconnects, all CQs created by the client are removed from the server and put into a `CLOSED` state on the client.
-   The server region is destroyed--When a server region is destroyed, all associated CQs are also cleaned up on the server and the region destroy event is sent to the client. On the client, the `CqListener.Close` method is called for all CQs on the region.

## Getting All Durable CQs Registered with the Server

To obtain a list of all durable CQs registered on the server, use the `QueryService.getAllDurableCqsFromServer` API.
