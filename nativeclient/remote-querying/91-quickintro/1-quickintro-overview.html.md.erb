title:  Remote Querying Basics

Use the Geode native client query API to query your cached data stored on a Geode cache server. The query is evaluated and executed on the cache server, and the results are returned to the native client.

You can also optimize your queries by defining indexes on the cache server.

The query language for the native client is essentially a subset of OQL (ODMG 3.0 Object Data Management Group, [http://www.odmg.org](http://www.odmg.org).), which is based on SQL-92. OQL is a SQL-like language with extended functionality for querying complex objects, object attributes, and methods.

It is assumed that you have general familiarity with SQL querying and indexing, and with the information on the native client cache.

The online C++ and .NET API documentation for the native client provides extensive details for all of the querying interfaces, classes and methods.

Query language features and grammar are described at [Querying](../../../developing/querying_basics/chapter_overview.html). This section describes areas that are unique to the native client.

If you are using the pool API, you should obtain the QueryService from the pool . For information about the pool API, see [Native Client Pool API](../../connection-pools/native-client-pool-api.html#native-client-pool-api).
