title:  Importing and Using Object Classes
---

To facilitate the specification of type in variable type declarations and in typecasting expressions, a query string can have `IMPORT` statements preceding the declarations. By using `IMPORT` in the query string, the client can tell the cache server about the class definition of the serialized object that is present in the cache server region.

The only place you can have a package name in a query is in an import statement. These are valid:

``` pre
IMPORT com.myFolder.Portfolio;
IMPORT com.myFolder.Portfolio AS MyPortfolio;
```

The first form of the import statement allows Portfolio to be used as the name of the class, `com.myFolder.Portfolio`. The second form provides an alternative class name, MyPortfolio, to be used. This is useful when a class name is not unique across packages and classes in a single query.

## Using Imported Classes

The following example uses imported classes:
``` pre
IMPORT com.commonFolder.Portfolio;
IMPORT com.myFolder.Portfolio AS MyPortfolio;
SELECT DISTINCT mpflo.status
FROM /portfolios pflo TYPE Portfolio,
/myPortfolios mpflo TYPE MyPortfolio,
WHERE pflo.status = 'active' and mpflo.id = pflo.id
```

This entire query string must be passed to the query engine, including the `IMPORT` statements.
Common type names do not require an `IMPORT` statement. The following table lists the types that are defined by the system and the Java types they represent.
