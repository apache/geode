title:  Serialize Using the PdxSerializable Class
---

Domain classes need to inherit the `PdxSerializable` abstract class to serialize and de-serialize the object. When you write objects using PDX serialization, they are distributed to the server tier in PDX serialized form.

When you run queries against the objects on the servers, only the fields you specify are deserialized. A domain class should serialize and de-serialize all its member fields in the same order in its `toData` and `fromData` method.

Use this procedure to program your domain object for PDX serialization using the `PdxSerializable` abstract class.

1.  In your domain class, implement `PdxSerializable`. Example:

    ``` pre
    class PdxObject: public PdxSerializable
    ```

2.  Program the `toData` function to serialize your object as required by your application.

    If you also use PDX serialization in Java or .NET for the object, serialize the object in the same way for each language. Serialize the same fields in the same order and mark the same identity fields.

3.  Program the `fromData` method to read your data fields from the serialized form into the object's fields.

    In your `fromData` implementation, use the same name as you did in `toData` and call the read operations in the same order as you called the write operations in your `toData` implementation.

4.  Optionally, program your domain object's hashCode and equals methods.

    Use the `markIdentityField` method to indicate that the given field name should be included in hashCode and equals checks of this object on a server.

    The fields that are marked as identity fields are used to generate the hashCode and equals methods of PdxInstance. Because of this, the identity fields should themselves either be primitives, or implement hashCode and equals.

    If no fields are set as identity fields, then all fields will be used in hashCode and equals checks. The identity fields should make marked after they are written using a `write`\* method.

## PdxSerializable Example

``` pre
class PdxObject: public PdxSerializable {

private:
    uint32_t m_id;
    char* m_str;

public:
    PdxObject(){};
    PdxObject(uint32_t id, char* str);
    virtual ~PdxObject();

    uint32_t getID() {
        return m_id;
    }

    char* getStr(){
        return m_str;
    }

    virtual void toData(PdxWriterPtr pw) const;
    virtual void fromData(PdxReaderPtr pr);
    CacheableStringPtr toString() const;
    virtual char* getClassName() const;
    static Cacheable* createDeserializable() {
        return new PdxObject();
    }
};

PdxObject::PdxObject(uint32_t i, char* str) {
    m_id = i;
    m_str = str;
}

PdxObject::~PdxObject() {
}

void PdxObject::toData( PdxWriterPtr pw ) const {
    pw->writeInt("id", m_id);
       pw->markIdentityField("id");
    pw->writeString("str", m_str);
}

void  PdxObject::fromData( PdxReaderPtr pr )
{
    m_id = pr->readInt("id");
    m_str = pr->readString("str");
}

char* getClassName() const{
{
    return "com.example.PdxType";
}

CacheableStringPtr PdxObject::toString() const {
       char idbuf[1024];
       sprintf(idbuf,"PdxObject: [ ID=%d ]",m_id);
       return CacheableString::create( idbuf );
}
```

    This topic demonstrates how you can perform operations on a PDX domain object after you have implemented PDX serializable in your domain class.
