To build with gradle, just run

./gradlew build

This will create the binary artifacts and run all of the tests but 
if for some reason you want to skip running the tests include -Dskip.tests=true on the gradle invocation.

To create a distribution run

./gradlew distTar

or

./gradlew distZip

the distribution archives will be located in gemfire-assembly/build/distributions/.
