To build with gradle, just run

./gradlew build

This will create the binary artifacts and run all of the tests but 
if for some reason you want to skip running the tests include -Dskip.tests=true on the gradle invocation. For example:

./gradlew build -Dskip.tests=true

To create a distribution run

./gradlew distTar

or

./gradlew distZip

the distribution archives will be located in geode-assembly/build/distributions/.

To create an unzipped distribution run

./gradlew installDist
