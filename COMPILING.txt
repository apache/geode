To build with gradle, just run

./gradle build

This will create the binary artifacts and run all of the tests but 
if for some reason you want to skip running the tests include -Dskip.tests=true on the gradle invocation. For example:

./gradle build -Dskip.tests=true

To create a distribution run

./gradle distTar

or

./gradle distZip

the distribution archives will be located in gemfire-assembly/build/distributions/.

To create an unzipped distribution run

./gradle installDist
