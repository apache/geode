      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

3. Distribution Obligations.
  3.1. Availability of Source Code.
  Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
  Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that
  Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this
  License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
  Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make
  available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in
  Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source
  Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
  for software exchange.

  3.2. Modifications.
  The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed
  by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
  Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient
  rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

  3.3. Required Notices.
  You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies
  You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter
  any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
  Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
  attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

  3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
  Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
  or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to
  charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
  to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so
  only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
  any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
  alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
  Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
  terms You offer.

  3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
  You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
  terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,
  which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for
  the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients
  rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License.
  If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
  different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
  differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
  Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
  Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

  3.6. Larger Works.
  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other
  code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
  Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
  requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.
  4.1. New Versions.
  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish
  revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
  version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided
  in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
  modify this License.

  4.2. Effect of New Versions.
  You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
  Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
  which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
  Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from
  being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
  version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
  available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
  originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
  to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
  the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the
  license steward.

  4.3. Modified Versions.
  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
  for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of
  this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to
  the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs
  from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license
  contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
  WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
  DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
  SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
  RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
  THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO
  USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
  DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.
  6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
  such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
  which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
  this License shall survive.

  6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
  judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
  Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred
  to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
  Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the
  Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)
  directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
  granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
  Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
  Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
  days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at
  the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
  period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software
  against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
  agreement with Participant.

  6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
  user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
  hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any
  distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER,
  ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY
  SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
  INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
  GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL
  OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
  INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
  SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
  SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
  OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION
  MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
  The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48
  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as
  that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial
  computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R.
  12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.

SIL Open Font License (https://opensource.org/licenses/OFL-1.1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apache Geode bundles the following files under the SIL OFL 1.1 license:

  - Font Awesome (font files) (http://fontawesome.io) Copyright (c) Dave
    Gandy

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
