/**
 * JSONStringer provides a quick and convenient way of producing JSON text. The texts produced
 * strictly conform to JSON syntax rules. No whitespace is added, so the results are ready for
 * transmission or storage. Each instance of JSONStringer can produce one JSON text.
 * <p>
 * A JSONStringer instance provides a <code>value</code> method for appending values to the text,
 * and a <code>key</code> method for adding keys before values in objects. There are
 * <code>array</code> and <code>endArray</code> methods that make and bound array values, and
 * <code>object</code> and <code>endObject</code> methods which make and bound object values. All of
 * these methods return the JSONWriter instance, permitting cascade style. For example,
 * 
 * <pre>
 * myString = new JSONStringer().object().key("JSON").value("Hello, World!").endObject().toString();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * which produces the string
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {"JSON":"Hello, World!"}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The first method called must be <code>array</code> or <code>object</code>. There are no methods
 * for adding commas or colons. JSONStringer adds them for you. Objects and arrays can be nested up
 * to 20 levels deep.
 * <p>
 * This can sometimes be easier than using a JSONObject to build a string.
