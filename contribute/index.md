# Contribute

Development of the code base for Geode began in 2002 as the commercial product GemFire. The open source version of Geode was released in April, 2015. 

The [primary contributors](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki/Apache-Incubator-Proposal#Initial_Committers) include long standing members of the GemFire engineering team, implementers and customers with long standing relationships.

The Apache Incubator Proposal for Geode can be found [here](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki/Apache-Incubator-Proposal)

Ideas for extending Geode code can be found in the wiki [here](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki/How-to-Contribute).

There are many ways to [support an open source software project beyond contributing code](http://opensource.com/business/14/12/8-ways-contribute-open-source-without-writing-code) to the master branch. For Project Geode, here are some ways you can contribute today:

* **Post Issues:** Build and run the [Project Geode source](https://network.pivotal.io/products/project-geode), and [post issues](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/issues) on the Project Geode GitHub site.

* **Documentation:** [Add to the documentation](https://github.com/project-geode/docs), and [submit new articles](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki) to the wiki for best practices and [user training](https://github.com/project-geode/training).

* **Website:** Improve the projectgeode.org website itself. For now it runs out of the [project GitHub](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/tree/gh-pages), but will hopefully to migrate to ASF infrastructure should they accept the proposal to incubate Project Geode.

* **Art & Design:** Offer to help with art & design of Project Geode. Pivotal has donated an initial look and feel, but the logos, branding, and identity are property of the Project.

* **Discuss:** Start and weigh in on discussions. Currently we are hosting threaded discussions on the [Project Geode Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/project-geode). Itâ€™s also common to find [Stack Overflow questions covering GemFire and Geode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/geode+or+gemfire). 

* **Present:** Give a presentation or create a video about the project.  We are already beginning to add presentations and [training materials](https://github.com/project-geode/training) as they are created.  Feel free to download and use.  If you are hosting an event, put it into the community calendar on the site. If you create a new presentation, please check it into the project GitHub.
